A roadmap to release 2.0
------------------------

Must have:

- Documentation
  - What is Carrot2
  - Getting source and building?
  - Brief overview of the (local) architecture
  - One-sentence summary for each carrot2 subproject
  - For more information: use mailing list :)

- Move command line applications from the commercial repository to
  the OS repository (D)


Nice to have:

- Take a look at: http://www.aduna-software.com/products/professional_search/autofocus/overview.view
  A very interesting Open Source desktop search that could benefit from clustering.
  Also a very interesting Open Source cluster visualisation component.

- (webapp) decrease the number of synchronizations in the broadcaster.

- Add OpenSearch Descriptor support for carrot2-input-opensearch?

- Unify coding style (reformat existing code)

- Check out Unicode segmentation spec (info from Andrzej Zydro):
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/tr29-10.html

- refactor Language use (tokenization, stemming) in Lingo.

- Highlight user search terms in document snippets in the local demo application (reuse
Lucene's highlighter?).

- A plugin for SOLR?
  http://incubator.apache.org/solr/

- Write a clustering plugin for Kneobase?

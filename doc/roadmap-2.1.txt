
A roadmap to release 2.1
------------------------

Must have:

- correct query time statistics to return an average in a time window of 5 minutes.

Nice to have:

- Add a "Show in clusters" feature to the webapp, which will highlight all
  clusters in the tree to which the selected document belongs

- Implement the "more..." tab in the webapp, so that we can add much more new
  data sources (MSN, *.gov.pl)

- Add metasearch input component (in this case the on-line demo could have
  tabs like "Web", "Wiki", "Jobs" etc.)

- Support shortcut-based tab switching in the demo-webapp (e.g. pressing Alt+G
  switches to the "Google" tab)

- Extend the "Search with Carrot2" section to add options similar
  to those on Clusty: http://clusty.com/sitesearch. Add information about
  the possibility to link directly to the iframes with the results?

- Move command line applications from the commercial repository to
  the OS repository (D)

- Add support for snippet extraction to the LuceneInputComponent (based on
  Lucene Highlighter)? Ideally, there would be a configuration switch that
  would decide if the summary should be initialized from a Lucene field as 
  it was, or the summary should be initialized with a "snippet" of the
  specified field.

- (webapp) AJAX-based tracking of the clusters the users choose to inspect
  This could be an interesting source of statistics, potentially useful for
  improving/ promoting certain clusters in the future. Implementation:
  when the user clicks on a cluster label (for the first time only?), make
  a background XmlHTTPRequest to send to the server: the query, the cluster
  label (+ parent labels?), the rank of the cluster?, the number of documents
  in the cluster?

- (webapp) decrease the number of synchronizations in the broadcaster.

- Add OpenSearch Descriptor support for carrot2-input-opensearch?

- Unify coding style (reformat existing code)

- Check out Unicode segmentation spec (info from Andrzej Zydro):
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/tr29-10.html

- refactor Language use (tokenization, stemming) in Lingo.

- Highlight user search terms in document snippets in the local demo application (reuse
Lucene's highlighter?).

- A plugin for SOLR?
  http://incubator.apache.org/solr/

- Write a clustering plugin for Kneobase?

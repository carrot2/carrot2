  <subtitle>What is &PROD; and what it is not</subtitle>

  <para>
    &PROD; is a library and a set of supporting applications you can use to build
    a search results clustering engine. Such an engine will <emphasis
    role="bold">organize your search results into topics</emphasis>, fully
    automatically and without external kowledge such as taxonomies or
    preclassified content.
  </para>

  <para>
    &PROD; contains two document clustering algorighms designed specifically for
    search results clustering: Suffix Tree Clustering and Lingo.
    &PROD; also contains components for fetching search results from several search
    engines, such as Bing, Google, but it also supports other
    sources of documents like Lucene or Solr indexes. 
  </para>

  <para>
    &PROD; <emphasis role="bold">is not a search engine</emphasis> itself, it
    does not have a crawler and indexer. There is a number of Open Source projects
    you can use to crawl (<link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/">Nutch</link>), 
    index and search (<link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</link>, 
    <link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</link>) your content, which
    can then be queried and clustered by &PROD;
  </para>

  <xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="introduction-workflow.xml" /> 

  <para>
    <xref linkend="chapter.faq" /> answers the questions most frequently asked
    on &PROD; mailing lists, it can also serve as a question-based index to the
    rest of this manual. <xref linkend="chapter.application-suite" />
    introduces applications available in &PROD; distribution and <xref
    linkend="chapter.getting-started" /> shows how to quickly set up &PROD; to
    cluster your own data. <xref linkend="chapter.tuning" /> discusses topics related
    to tuning &PROD; clustering, while <xref linkend="chapter.customizing" /> shows 
    how to customize &PROD; applications. <xref linkend="chapter.advanced-topics" /> covers
    some more advanced use cases of &PROD; and <xref linkend="chapter.troubleshooting" />
    provides solutions to common problems. Finally, <xref linkend="chapter.architecture" /> discusses
    &PROD; architecture and internals, while <xref linkend="chapter.components"/> 
    is an in-depth reference of &PROD; components.

          o  minor feature, update or fix.

Version  [C] Information

HEAD
          #  Snowball stemmers were quite old. King's was stemmed into King' for example. 
             Upgrade fixes that problem.
          
          o  Build system improvements (speed).

          +  Demo web application using local interfaces. Initial version.
          
          o  Core classes refactoring. Several classes removed or slightly redesigned to simplify 
             code.

          #  Snowball stemmers were quite old. King's was stemmed into King' for example. 
             Upgrade fixes that problem.
          
          +  Local interface to FuzzyAnts added.

          +  Added proguard obfuscation infrastructure.

          #  The cache in demo application did not work properly for input components
             with the same input component class customizable by parameters set in the constructor
             (such as the opensearch). An explicit equivalence class object 
             is now required in the RawDocumentProducerCacheWrapper.

          +  Added carrot2-input-opensearch input component, contributed by Julien Nioche.

1.0.2     (svn version: 1000) I thought it's a good Subversion number to release
             a minor update. The update includes a few fixes to the demo application
             and will not be officially released on SourceForge (with this we will
             wait until some functionality is added).

          +  Added initial version of HAOG clustering algorithm.

1.0.1

          +  Added speed/ performance button to the demo application.

          #  Implemented a workaround for issues with long text sequences in cluster label
             display.

          +  STC clustering component refactored. Adopted for the local pipeline 
             (tokenizer, case normalization). Remote version uses embedded local
             controller.

          o  Added 'identity' XSLT argument to carrot2-input-xml.

          #  YahooAPI input occasionally threw an exception due to incorrect result from Yahoo.
             A workaround is not to throw an exception at all -- YahooAPI isn't stable enough to
             rely on it. 

1.0          We're putting a label on the, otherwise stable for a long time, code. Release 1.0
             also brings a refactored local demo/tuning application and several minor technical
             enhancements.

                <p>
                The first version of Carrot was originally written by <a href="http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dweiss/">Dawid Weiss</a>.
                It has evolved from a pretty closed search results clustering system
                into an open, modular framework for pipelined data processing. These changes were
                significant enough to justify the change of project's name to
                <carrot-text/>. Currently the core development is performed by Dawid Weiss and
                <a href="http://www.man.poznan.pl/~stachoo/">Stanisław Osiński</a>, although many other contributors donated their work and
                patches back to the project (their list is in the CVS).

                <p>Carrot is mainly written in Java programming language, because of it's great flexibility
                and numerous supporting technologies. Carrot also uses several open source projects -- we would
                like to thank all the contributors and supporters of free and open source software.</p>

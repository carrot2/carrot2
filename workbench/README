SETTING UP THE ENVIRONMENT (workbench):

1. You need to download set of plugins, which will become your target platform (it is a good
practice to have separate development platform and target platform). What you will download depends
on your needs:


*  Platform Runtime Binary: enough to build and launch the workbench,
or
   Platform SDK: enough to buld and launch the workbench, SRC added, necessary for context assist to work,

* RCP for All Platforms (aka delta pack): necessary for building
products for several platforms.

* Eclipse Test Framework: necessary for headless tests

Download page:

http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.3.1.1-200710231652/index.php
(v. 3.3.1.1 is used by developer as a target platform, any version 3.3+ can also be used)

2. Unpack all downloaded packages to the same directory somewhere on disk,
in such a way, that plugins/ and features/ directories from every package end up in the same directory respecively
(we will call this directory TARGET_ROOT).

3. Copy org.eclipse.pde.runtime_<version>.jar to $TARGET_ROOT$/plugins (needed for Error Log view).

4. (* DELETED *)

5. In your development Eclipse go to Plugin Development -> Target Platform preference page, point
location to $TARGET_ROOT$\eclipse directory and click Reload. All plugins should be selected.

6. Go to org.carrot2.workbench project, open Workbench.product file, on Overview page, in
Testing section, choose 'Launch an Eclipse application'. Workbench should open :)

7. Go to org.carrot2.workbench.test project, open WorkbenchTest.product file, do the same as in point 6. Workbench should open :)
(Additional menu items might appear, it's ok. Testing feature has more dependencies, some of them not required when not testing. They add these menus).

========================================================================================
HEADLESS BUILD AND TESTING:

1. Set up the environment (see above). When this does not work, headless build most probably also won't.

2. CD $3.0-PROTO$, create workbench.properties file (I suggest to copy workbench.properties.example file and rename it).

3. Edit workbench.properties as described inside the sample file.

4. CD $3.0-PROTO$/workbench/org.carrot2.workbench.core.test and create test.properties 
(I suggest to copy test.properties.example file and rename it).

5. >> ant -f build-workbench.xml build

6. Directory build-dir should be created, inside in tmp/workbench/ is build application

7. >> ant -f build-workbench.xml test

8. Directory test-dir should be created, inside in tmp/workbench/ is test application and XML files with test results.

=======================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING (aka it won't build or launch although Ula says it should):

1. Clean all projects.

2. In Workbench.product file, Overview page choose 'Synchronize' before launching.

3. In Target Platform preference page, choose 'Add Required Plugins' or 'Select all'.

4. Still doesn't work? Open 'Error Log' view. Go to Workbench.product run configuration, in Main tab
find out where Workspace Data Location is set. Import .log file from there in 'Error Log' view,
maybe it will help to diagnose whats wrong.

5. ??

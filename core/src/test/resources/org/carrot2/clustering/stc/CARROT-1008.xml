		<snippet>From  manes magpie linknet com  Steve Manes  Subject  Re  Gun Control  was Re  We re Mad as Hell at the TV News   Jim De Arras  jmd cube handheld com  wrote      Last year the US suffered almost 10 000 wrongful or accidental     deaths by handguns alone  FBI statistics    In the same year  the UK     suffered 35 such deaths  Scotland Yard statistics    The population     of the UK is about 1 5 that of the US  10 000    35   5     Weighted     for population  the US has 57x as many handgun-related deaths as the     UK   And  no  the Brits don t make up for this by murdering 57x as     many people with baseball bats     You just can t compare this way   All homicides must be shown  per capita  not     just handguns   The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred     murder weapon  but ban them  and some other weapon will step in as the     favorite   As a  favorite   sure   As lethal  not likely   A study of violence in Chicago produced this table     Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks        Resulting in Death          Weapon    Deaths As Percentage of Attacks  ---------------------------------------------------------------  Knives  16 518 total attacks    2 4  Guns  6 350 total attacks   12 2   Source  Firearms and Violence in American Life   It might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns that they would find a way to kill as often with knives   If this were so  knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate  and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used  like Vancouver  would show a higher fatality rate   But the Nat l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case   It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks  which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants   the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks   In fact  the reverse was true   What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill   Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury  multiple stabs wounds  wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest  etc   Most gun homicides did not show this pattern   Rather  more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim    Source  Report on Firearms and Violence    Then  since England    USA  my ancestors left because of the oppression  you     must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to     be able to draw any meaning at all   England has essentially legalized drugs      so there are no drug gangs battling for turf  etc   there   If you drop out the     drug related killings here  the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful   There are a lot of factors which make a difference   Actually  I m not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans  There are more cultural  beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities   I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks   I don t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US  whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi   On the other hand  we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar  namely the Canadians   In fact  an exhaustive  seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver  British Columbia and Seattle  Washington    cities with roughly the same population  urban economy  geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control   In Seattle  handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense   After a 30-day waiting period  a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon   The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted   In Vancouver  self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun   Concealed weapons are not permitted  Recreational uses of handguns  target shooting  collecting  are regulated by the province   Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit   A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs   Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box  In short  gun control but not unreasonably so   Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws   Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties   The researchers studied all cases of robbery  assault  simple and aggravated   burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1 1 80 to 12 31 86  In defining the cases  they used the same standard  the FBI s Unified Crime Report   Results  during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver  1 09   1 11    Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates   99   18 925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12 034 in Vancouver   The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver  1 18   1 15  and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher  1 16   1 12    However  when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault  a clear pattern emerged  Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons  firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle   In fact  7 7 times as often   Over the seven-year study  388 homicides occurred in Seattle  11 3 per 100 000  vs  204 homicides in Vancouver  6 9 per 100 000   After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations  the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle  as compared to Vancouver  was found to be 1 63   When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death  the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons  excluding firearms  in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver  Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms   Handguns accounted for roughly 85  of homicides involving firearms   Handguns were 4 8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver   The authors of the report also investigated  legally justifiable  homicides  self-defense    Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study  11 of which were committed by police   Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred  17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver   Only 13 involved firearms   After excluding these cases  there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings   -------  This is  I feel  a very fair report   One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa  Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC  Chicago  Los Angeles and Houston   Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means   This report shows differently  If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons  we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle   However  during the study interval  Vancouver s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle  suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods   As well  ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report   Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense  these cases accounted for less than 4  of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period   And  as was reported  Seattle apparently didn t enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense    Heavily quoted source  Handgun Regulation

		<snippet>From  rats cbnewsc cb att com  Morris the Cat  Subject  Vancouver Seattle Study Critiques   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open letter by Dr  Paul H  Blackman  Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA  NRA Official Journal 1 89  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir   By now  we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine s publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data  followed by announcements of  momentus  scientific  findings  These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs  and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings  Generally  while they at least present a few interesting data  however meaningless  the studies misinterpret statistics  and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists   The latest effort --  Handgun Regulations  Crime  Assaults  and Homicide  A Tale of Two Cities   by J H  Sloan  et al   with the accompanying  editorial   Firearms Injuries  A Call for Science   by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control  November 10   however  is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings  in no particular order    1  The authors misleadingly cite Wright  et al   Ref  1  to   support the statement that  some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide   Wright  et al   in fact studied and rejected that  contention     2  The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances  histories   demographic characteristics  and the like  In fact  the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle  Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and  the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver   It is the different back-  grounds  problems  circumstances  and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide     3  The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada s gun law   compared to Washington State s  But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978  As it happens  in the three years prior to that  1975-  1977   Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year  one-eighth  involving handguns   Ref  2  and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year  one-eigth involving  handguns  Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference  Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen     4  The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law  Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample  Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason  Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar  control    Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen  opposite   scientific  conclusions would follow  Vancouver s homicide  rate  exceeds  that of such  wild west  cities in Texas as  El Paso  Corpus Christi  Austen  and  in Colorado  Colorado  Springs   Ref  3     5  The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns  are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver   They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms handguns  The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver  But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle  and counts primarily  protective  handgun  owners  The second  however  tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver  and counts  non-protective  handguns  for the most part  Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection  registration figures are  meaningless  There are 66 000 registered handguns in New York  City  New York Daily News  Sept  27  1987   Comparing the two   that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100 000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver  meaning Vancouver  has a greater  prevalence of weapons  than New York City     The second method of measuring gun density is  Cook s gun  prevalence index  a previously validated measure of intercity  differences   But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory   Ref  4  Normally  second opinions are sought from a  different doctor  More significantly  the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide  So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse  Unsurprisingly  gun misuse in homicide   42  in Seattle  14  in Vancouver  is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide  divided by two  41  in Seattle  12  in  Vancouver   The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms  or of handguns  in Seattle and  Vancouver     6  The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada  They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun  and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection  The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case     7  The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate  beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm  There is no measure of  the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers  their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions  arrest  rates for other offenses  conviction rates  actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes  violent crimes without guns   or gun law violations  or incarceration rates  Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences   the authors of the NEJM  tale of two cities  fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control     8  The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed  Such is not  the case  Criminologists  Ref  5-8  have found that almost  650 000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals  and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape  robbery  assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim  It is interesting  nonetheless  that the authors  reported the same number  four  of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100  of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms     9  The Centers for Disease Control  which funded the  study    editorially praised the paper   Ref  9  saying it  applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms  particularly  handguns   There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for  scientific methods  by a sociologists or  criminologists  The Vancouver-Seattle  study  is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males  one aged 25  and the other 40  and without first taking their vital signs   administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo  then taking their blood pressure  and  on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure    announcing in a  special article  a new medical breakthrough   It would be nice to think that such a  study  would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM     Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as  scientific  breakthroughs  in  special articles  and editorials relating  to firearms  we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in  Handgun Regulations  Crime  Assaults   and Homicides  A Tale of Two Cities  and  Firearm Injuries  A Call  for Science   Clearly  all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America        REFERENCES  1  Wright JD  et al

 Someone once wrote   Statistics are like a bikini   What they real is    suggestive  but what they conceal is vital    The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide   Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine  the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban  may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community         The nine medical doctors who published  Handgun Regulations  Crime     Assaults  and Homicide  essentially reasoned in three steps   1  Despite    many historical  social  and demographic similarities   2  Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate  3  because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available   The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable   The overall homicide rate in Seattle  for the period    1980-86  was 11 3 per 100 000 popuation  compared with 6 9 in Vancouver     Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle   The question then becomes     Why        The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion  as claimed in the third step of their reasoning     that Vancouver s handgun regulations are much more stringent   But their    evidence on the difference in gun  availabilty  is indirect and     unpersuasive  indeed  they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist   They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle  but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact  the opposite could be true   We    are therefore being asked  at the conclusion of the study  to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established        Indeed  the situation is even more troublesome   The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver   Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable        The second bit of evidence is  Cook s gun prevalence index   which stands    at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver   Cook s index    however  does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in     various cities   It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage    of homicides and suicides involving firearms        In the present case  the index shows only that in homicides and suicides     firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver   To take    Cook s index as a measure of general firearms availability  it must be    assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides    is directly related to their relative availability in the general     population   But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove  To    assume what one is seeking to prove  then to  prove  it on the basis of    that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything        Even if we were to grant  on the basis of no compelling evidence  that    guns are less common in Vancouver  we might still question what causes what     The authors attribute Seattle s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership   But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words     that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership  not vice versa        In fact  it was once commonly argued that Great Britain s low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation s strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted   To invoke    an ancient methodological saw  correlation is not cause        Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership   The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are  similar in    many ways   implying that they differ mainly in gun availability  gun-law    stringency  and crime rates   This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that  all    else is equal  among things being compared        Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways  but a closer look     reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime    or homicide rates   The cities are closely matched in what percentage    of their population is white  79 percent and 76 percent    But Seattle    is about 10 percent black  while Vancouver is less than 0 5 percent     Vancouver s minority population is overwhelmingly Asian   So although the    authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-    dozen readily available demographic indicators  they have not shown    that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out        In fact  the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is    particularly relevant in light of the study s breakdown of homicide rates    according to the race of the victim   For the white majority  the homicide    rates are nearly identical--6 2 per 100 000 in Seattle  6 4 in Vancouver     The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due    entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities   For blacks     the observed difference in homicide rate is 36 6 to 9 5 and for Hispanics    26 9 to 7 9    Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison    problematic  but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver    Racial    minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle    than in Vancouver  the white majority is equally likely to be slain    in either city        Since the nearly 2 1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3 1 or 4 1 differences between minority     groups  it is fair to ask why postulated difference in  gun availability      or gun-law strigency  would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites   Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver    Studies in the United States  incidentally     do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership         Or are other explanations more plausible   Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it   What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse   Of homelessness among each cty s minority population    The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi    Unemployment among young  central-city  nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent   What is the comparable Canadian    percentage        The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways  as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries   Absent    more detailed analysis  nearly any of these  many ways  might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates   In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver  all else is  not  equal        The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide    result in a  complex picture    They do not acknowledge that the ensuing    complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument   They    also acknowledge that  socio-economic status is probably an important    confounding factor in our comparison   remarking further that  blacks       in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of    Vancouver s population    Given the evidence presented in the article     it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle    and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle s racial    minorities   But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility     since  detailed information about household incomes according to race    is not available for Vancouver         The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example   If one were to take all U S  couties and compare them in terms    of  1  pervalence of gun ownership and  2  crime or homicide rates  one     would find an astonishing pattern  Counties with more guns have less crime     Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime   Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account   In this example  the  hidden variable  is city size  Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas  whereas crime is a big-city    problem   If researchers failed to anticipate this variable  or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences  they coud be very    seriously misled   In the study at hand  the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables     and their results are impossible to interpret        In the editorial  Firearm Injuries  A Call for Science  accompanying    the study  two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying  scientific methods  to a problem of grave public    heath significance   But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research  the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out   Absent such effort  the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research   That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern       James D  Wright is professor of sociology at Tulane University   He has    researched extensively on the relationship of firearms and crime

		<snippet>From  cathy LANCE ColoState Edu  Cathy Smith  Subject  Letter to a Liberal Colleague -- L  Neil Smith  Posted by Cathy Smith for L  Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE   AUTHOR S NOTE    Adrian  -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house    Dear Adrian     I m way behind schedule on my current book again  so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you re free to believe  or not  I can back  with evidence and logic I ve neither time nor energy to present  now   I ve written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future   When I do  I ll make sure you get copies     There are many arguments I might make  from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police  see Don Kates in the Jan   10  1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL  to the real effect of prohibition   shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs  but I ll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note     First  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility     Second  publication of some latter-day  scientific study  doesn t  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying     Third  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility     Fourth  as often happens with these things  the  study  doesn t  support the gun prohibitionists  original numerical contentions  anyway  but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies  omissions  and distortions     Fifth  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility     Sixth  the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions  Carl Bakal  author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS  even confessed to it publicly  makes the value of this  present  study  dubious  to say the least     Seventh  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil   and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility     Eighth  given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat   not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction   you  should be better aware than most people how  progress  -- in  designing  studies  to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data   A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create  studies   proving  that pornography causes crime    More naive  and probably more honest  efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary     Ninth  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility     Tenth  another reason to doubt all such  studies  is that human  behavior  as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates  is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified   The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization     Eleventh  the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil   and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility     Twelfth  the  study  is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide  which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right  sometimes with ancillary social  benefits   If anything  perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense     Thirteenth and finally  the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article  whatever their shortcomings  and they are  many   are correct in this instance   the  study  is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural  fundamental  and inalienable human  individual  civil  and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility     And because of that  Adrian  even if the  study  were valid  it  wouldn t deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however   whenever  and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody s  permission  In this I m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves  whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun  while they still can     Before the  68 Gun Control Act  most of the  shooting fraternity   viewed handguns  incorrectly  as it turned out  as inaccurate   ineffective toys   There probably weren t six million of them in  the whole country   Now  thanks to Kennedy  Metzenbaum  the Bradys   and their ilk -- AMERICA S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year   The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control  et al  are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you ll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are     Look   gun-making isn t an arcane or difficult art  and by the way   it s easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic   the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference  the  self-loading pistol  is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further    Even if it were difficult  there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America  with an estimated  half life   of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel   Guns are gonna  be around a long time  Adrian  whether you like it or not   As for me  to paraphrase Elmer Keith  regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides  I m always going to be armed   And I  will always work to see that others are  as well   The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from   We can t be stopped by passing laws  we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently     So what s the point     L  Neil Smith Author   THE PROBABILITY BROACH  THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE  HENRY MARTYN   and  forthcoming

A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again  - A double-action revolver  almost all of them  can be hand-cocked first    but will fire merely by pulling the trigger  - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round  - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety  but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion  even one handed  - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos  Can be faster depending on users   - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first  time spent which can be fatal  And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize  hey  it s jammed   before starting to do anything   about clearing it  - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer  Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked  but a safety engaged  I do not consider   this safe however  You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver  - There are some double-action semi-autos out there  but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training   Some police departments switched to Glocks  and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers  Too many were having accidents  partly due to the poor training they received  Not that Glocks require rocket scientists  but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR   Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don t know nothing about firearms  Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention  I do not seek here to say  semi-autos are junk  merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid  A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot   Gun control is hitting what you aim at  If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything  Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit  I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver  If I haven t hit what I m aiming at in the first 5 shots  something is quite seriously wrong somewheres  While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases  overwhelmingly the   of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5   What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime  Why the same nice simple  38 revolvers that the police often use  Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier  357 Magnum  but anyway       ObPlea  Don t flame me  I prefer semi-autos for most things  But they          introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal   --   If everything had gone as planned  everything would have been perfect    -BATF spokesperson on CNN 3 2 93  regarding failed raid attempt in TX  </snippet>

said it   I admire such honesty   -     1  Guns are made to KILL people  not to shoot target or to    have something more macho than stamps to collect       Fire an Anschutz  22  then come back and talk to us   You re letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking   Either that  or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events  Funny  you d think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse   -     2  It IS more easy to kill injure someone with a gun than   with a knife or a bat  as in baseball    Precisely   That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry  Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius  you know  but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time   To extend this a bit further  you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon   Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult  and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have   I ve spent a few years practicing with a sword   I can take the common person armed with one  though self-defense isn t the reason I own one    My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me  gun vs  gun  with only a month of training   That makes firearms much better  in our eyes     3  It s not very wise to compare two completely different   countries like USA and  let s say  Island on issues like   crime and violence   Excellent point   Perhaps you aren t so naive after all     4  Yes  the problem is  people committing crimes  not the tools   beeing used  but 1  should be taken into concideration   Taken into consideration in what respect   Though quite wrong  let s make it a blanket statement for weapons in general   This has been taken into consideration   We call use of them aggrivated assault  assault with a deadly weapon  assault with intent to kill  attempted murder  and a whole host of others  and tack on extra prison time     We have a very strict gun-legislation in Norway  but until recently   it was possible for enyone over 18 years to buy a shotgun    Shotguns are used mainly for hunting in Norway       but because it   was so easy to accuire one  it was THE most used gun in crimes   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available   You conquered your land  among others  a full millenia before we were thought of  and shortly thereafter weapons weren t quite so common   I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too  since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes   I m curious  though  were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime  or were they aquired by other means   Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun     And -unbelievable- the use of guns in crime fell        There are now a new law against wearing long knives in public    and why should it be allowed      Come on down to honest Erik s Used Swords   Here s a slightly-used short sword   THE  battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century   Only  39 95 with trade-in   Easy financing    Sorry  I couldn t resist   You guys still slicing each other with long knives  or is this really not a problem     What I  as an scandinavian  have problems to understand is that    you  Americans  have a more liberal view on guns and violence   than on nudity and sex    Try showing a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder     I m all for that   What gets me is that scandanavians  and yes  I m only a couple generations off the longship  used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago  yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing  Maybe you had a bit more time  and a more homogeneous culture  to become civilized with     Yes  I know a little American history  but is it a civil human   right to have an assault gun in your home and or an handgun   in your car    Yes   We re too damned violent  partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don t identify ourselves as  Americans  first and foremost   I m rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage  whereas I suspect you couldn t care less about that 2  Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055   The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important   Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good  In America  the individual is more important than the masses   Personal liberties are prized above all   This is  sadly  changing of late  but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans   I d hazard a guess that  were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere   One poor effect of this culture we have is that we re looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population   My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke  low Dane   whereas others spoke  high Dane    It was shortly after World War II  as I remember  that  low Dane  was abolished so there was one common dialect   We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem  because we have even more obvious means of identifying an  outsider        The bad english is not my fault  it s probably     the keyboard-software or the quality of the     subtext on tv        Take heart  yours is better than 90  of what gets posted by native speakers  Any helpful hints for our educational system   People have this annoying tendency to drop out of school and sell drugs over here      -  And what kind of name is Thomas Parsli   Here  you can use my great grandfather s before he changed it  Christian Aarskog   That s a great one for getting mispronounced   I think that s why he changed it  I don t think he needs it anymore  -       Dan Sorenson  DoD  1066 z1dan exnet iastate edu viking iastate edu      ISU only censors what I read  not what I say   Don t blame

the kind of stuff you and I would be doing  twenty-to-life for  yet he walks free  This BS happens all  the time  In fact  it happens so much that no one really  cares anymore    Legitimacy  is a non-issue  Legality is  a non-issue  So long as we get T-bones and our MTV  who  gives a rats ass         No arguments against RKBA can withstand scientific scrutiny        They don t have to  Like so many other things  the issue    is one of -perception- rather than boring statistics              Excuse me  sir  but  you  were the one suggesting that arguments   for RKBA would not stand up to scientific scrutiny    No  I claimed that no one is interested in the statistical  aspects of the argument  Pure emotion  like the abortion issue      Every time some young innocent is gunned-down in a drive    by  every time some kid is murdered for a jacket  every    time a store clerk is executed for three dollars in change     every time some moron kills his wife because she took the    last beer from the fridge  every time someone hears a  bang     in the night      the RKBA dies                Emotion is hard to argue against   But it must be done anyway if   emotion is wrong    Argue away     you can t win             The stats are not all  that     clearly behind firearms -

guns   mikey ccwf cc utexas edu  Strider     8 51 pm  Apr 12  1993     I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun   but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT   You still haven t offered  I ve been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now   even contributed a few comments  but this stuff  I d rather face a knife than a gun  has GOT to come from ignorance   I used to think pretty much the same thing  then I got  educated    People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be  or how quickly you can be killed with one   Most people don t understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick  within a minute or so  death   The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other   Many people not realizing how deadly knives are  try their luck  and thus more get injured by knives   A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it s only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon   A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter   Most people have never seen knife wounds  aside from slicing a finger by accident   From 21 feet or so  a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands  even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill   From inside 10 feet or so  a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun   A knife is utterly silent  it never jams and never runs out of ammunition   It is limited only by the speed  dexterity skill and ability of it s wielder   Criminals in general are young  fast and strong   It s interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices   I ve talked to several well trained martial artists   They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut  hopefully not as bad as the attacker   Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment   Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife  say a popsicle stick or tooth brush   Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison   If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat  or in the case of an experienced attacker  parts of your body falling off onto the ground   A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds   Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two   I ve seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second   I m old  over weight and slow   I can do it in 1 3 seconds   I ve seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe    How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK   In this case the attacker used the HANDLE  not the pointed end    Add to this the  fact  that hand gun  stopping  power is largely a myth  Except in the case of a central nervous system shot  or a round that destroys the skeletal structure  it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to  take effect    This is true of even heart shots   There is the case of the police woman in L A   the first recorded survivor of a  357 shot to the heart   That lady not only killed her attacker  but chased him down to do it   All four of her shots  fired after SHE had been shot  struck the perp   Atta girl   The bullet entered her on a downward angle  went through the apex of her heart  down through the diaphragm  clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen   It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole   She died about six times on the operating table  but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months   She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest   She was on her way home so happened to have her gun   No  she doesn t think civilians should have the same rights   Sigh   The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker  you d better be planning on doing some dodging   A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis   People can often walk  a little  on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them   Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons   The target is as large as the traditional  center of mass  and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon  assuming a caliber powerful enough to  do the job    Hot  38 s on up will usually do this   Remember folks  the idea isn t to  take em with you  but for you to live and them to fail  whatever the consequences for them   This the reason  killing them  isn t our goal  or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive   I don t want to face a violent attack of any sort   Knowing what I now know  I can t rightly say I d rather face a knife than an gun   It would have to depend on the attacker  and if I could pick and choose  I WOULDN T BE THERE   This is really the bottom line   Criminals do not fear the law   Criminals do not fear the weapon   They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes   Rick  </snippet>

writes     Abuse by the goverment   This seems to be one of the main problems  Any harder gun-control  would just be abused by the goverment      Either some of you are a little paranoid  no offence              Mr  Parsli  I have to take exception at this   There are verifiable  previous  examples  of levels of U S  governments abusing gun-control restrictions   I don t think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future   After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove    OR you should  get a new goverment   You do have elections            I d love to   But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents  there s not a lot I can do            It s silly to suggest that if there s anything we can t trust the government to do  and therefore the government should be allowed to do it  then we should change governments   Down that road lies total government power    I ve never been a fan of totalitarianism    Guns  n Criminals   MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen          This is very likely    Known criminals can NOT buy weapons  that s one of the points of gun control   And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia  and most of europe    we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns          The North American Continent is not Europe  no matter how many people would like it to be   Drugs are very illegal and they re here   For years Canada has crowed about its gun control   If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent  then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U S   yet they still don t  Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border  which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled  then I really can t accept that argument    Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one   What I meant was that cars CAN kill  but they are not GUNS          No  there are approximately 31 000 deaths due to guns in the U S   two-thirds of which are suicides    Unfortunately I don t have suicide rates for Norway    However  this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate    The issue  I hope      I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem   Guns are not a problem  but the way they are used is      and what are they for       I think this discusion is interesting when you think of  ex Jugoslavia   They should all have weapons  it s their rigth to have them  and if they use them  to kill other  Innocent  people the problem is humans  not guns         The problem s been humans since before we had stone axes   The fct of the matter is simply this   If nobody ever assaulted anybody  whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent         Yet weapons are  built    I d suggest  then  that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons         Anyway  the Bosnians et al  have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years   Taking away their guns  even if we could  would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality    If 50  of ALL murders was done with axes  would you impose some regulations on them  or just say that they are ment to be used at trees  and that the axe is not a problem   it s the  axer       An example  don t flame me just because not exactly 50  are killed by guns              In the U S   approximately 60  of murders are commited with firearms   50  with handguns  10  with non-handguns    The reason I say that guns  per  se  are not the problem  is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe s countries  entire  violent crime rate   I don t really think we ve got more knives or fists            In any case  I think examples of gun control  applied  to the U S  have been abkect failures  just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition   Until you deal with  why  people are doing what they are doing  you won t solve your problem   And if the problem is  violent crime  you shouldn t concentrate on the tools instead   The  vast  majority of guns is never  ever misused    On the order of 99 5  over the entire lifetime of the gun    This says to me that you can t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse    Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect  themselves  Is this a good situation             The situation is not  good  in that people fear for their lives  But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots  protecting their shops with guns   Would it have been better they  too  lost their livelihoods    Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem            The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles  no it isn t  However  if that problem becomes a violent action  then yes  it can be appropriate   Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it          You have to examine which problem you re referring to   If you re discussing someone violently assaulting you  then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop    Hopefully simply letting them know you re prepared to shoot them would be enough  as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners     If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals  and their neighbor who have  guns  what do you think will happen     I mean if everybody had a gun in USA          45  of Households have some form of firearm  usually a long gun  That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans  Firearm ownership is most likely among educated  well-off whites  the group  least  likely to be involved in violent crime          You may take that for what it s worth   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ  of Tenn  Div  of Cont  Education Info  Services Group PA146008 utkvm1

		<snippet>From  betz gozer idbsu edu  Andrew Betz  Subject  Randy Weaver trial update  Day 4   Note  These trial updates are summarized from reports in the  Idaho Statesman  and the local NBC affiliate television station  KTVB Channel 7   Randy Weaver Kevin Harris trial update  Day 4   Friday  April 16  1993 was the fourth day of the trial   Synopsis  Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen   Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied   The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence   Although Spence has not explicitly stated so  one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper   Cooper is the government s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan  Spence attacked Cooper s credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper s statements last September and those made in court  Cooper conceded that   You have all these things compressed into a few seconds   It s difficult to remember what went on first    Cooper acknowledged that he carried a  9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel    I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver   Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver s dog   When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan s M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead  Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down   Spence continued by asking with how many agents  and to what extent  had Cooper discussed last August s events  Cooper responded   If you re implying that we got our story together  you re wrong  counselor    Spence continued to advance the defense s version of the events  Namely  that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver s dog   Cooper disagreed   Assistant U S  Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence s virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper  arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time   Howen also complained  that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense s version of the events   U S  District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections  however  both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys    I m not going to play games with either counsel   This has been a personality problem from day 1  so start acting like professionals    Spence told the judge that   When all the evidence is in  we ll see that     his  agent Larry Cooper  testimony is not credible  that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events    Spence continued   We re going to find   that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr  Cooper and the other witnesses    Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen s repeated objections would prevent a fair trial   We can t have a fair trial if the jury believes I m some sort of charlatan  if the jury believes I m bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I m violating court orders    Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen s objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was  preposterous  and denied the motion for a mistrial   Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting   The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton   The prosecution s purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence  However  the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper s credibility   Defense attorney Ellison Matthews  Harris  other attorney  questioned Rampton about the dog   Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver s dog without being detected   Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember 15  1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected  if the dog chased them  Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that  but he could not remember when   He then stated that   I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper  but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted    Monday  April 19  1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial   Scheduled is the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton    </snippet>

		<snippet>From  betz gozer idbsu edu  Andrew Betz  Subject  Randy Weaver trial update  Day 1    Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial  After a large response  about 15 email messages   I ve decided that there is sufficient interest here on t p g  to warrant posting       file follows       Hi Folks   As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list  I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver Kevin Harris trial   Yesterday marked the seating of the jury   Apparently no other legal activities occurred   The jury was selected and things start today   More interesting is what happenned outside   About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse   One woman carried a sign that read   Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and  son s name - I forget  Weaver    On the evening news she said   I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion  I thought we all did    Nice sound bite  grin    The news reporter also interviewed some guy named  Tim  who refused to give his last name   Not to prejudge the guy  but he looked like a neo-nazi   He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial   Tim  had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he d arrest   I don t know the finer points of this one   Perhaps there s a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something  what happenned to the First Amendment       Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo   err   ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS   Welcome to the world of Big Brother   Anyhow  Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he didn t think it would help Weaver s case any   He said he was confident that  once the evidence came out  that Weaver would be aquitted   More stuff as it comes available   Drew </snippet>

		<snippet>From  shepard netcom com  Mark Shepard  Subject  S414  Brady bill  loopholes   Hi  I ve just finished reading S414  and have several questions about the Brady bills  S414 and HR1025    1   Are  these the current versions of the Brady bill       What is the status of these bills   I ve heard they re  in committee        How close is that to being made law   2  S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar   Are there any important    differences I missed   3  S414 seems to have some serious loopholes    A  S414 doesn t specify an  appeals  process to wrongful denial during      the waiting period  other than a civil lawsuit      S414 has an appeals      process once the required instant background check system is established       but not before     B  the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying approving      using existing records  so who would I sue in  A  above to have an      inaccurate record corrected     C  S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person      can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer  CLEO  of an      immediate threat to his or her life  or life of a household member       But S414 doesn t say exactly what is considered a  threat   nor does      it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception      statement  True   Have I misunderstood   Any other  holes   4  With just S414  what s to stop a person with a  clean  record from    buying guns  grinding off the serial numbers  and selling them to crooks     At minimum  what additional laws are needed to prevent this       Seems at min  a  gun counting  scheme would be needed     e g    John Doe owns N guns     So  if S414 passes  I wouldn t be surprised    to see legislation for stricter  harder-to-forge I D  s plus national gun    registration  justified by a need to make the Brady bill work   Please comment   I m mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation--I don t mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any all waiting-period bills ever proposed    MarkS    shepard netcom com </snippet>

my favorite  there are valid advantages to semi-autos   I suggest reading Massad Ayoob s  I know  some people can t stand him and think he s full of bull  but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful  book  The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work   or something  like that    He defines a number of ways that semi-auto s are different  and that  different is good    The main advantage is not in increased firepower  but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode   There is also a certain  propriatory nature  of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn   This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos  but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun          Define  armed better   Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the    Colt  45  Does one fires faster than the other  Nope  Aside from which    faster rate of fire is usually not desirable  Sure it makes the other    guys duck for cover  but just  YOU  trying hitting anything with a Thompson    in hose-mode  This is why the military is limiting it s M-16 now to    3-round burst-fire  Simple semi-auto would be better  but the troops    like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo  something    often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful          A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber         - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull      the trigger again     - A double-action revolver  almost all of them  can be hand-cocked first       but will fire merely by pulling the trigger   Yes  but this is best done with a two hand hold   With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock  or must fire double action   The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot       - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again      to rotate to the next round   I m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point   In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round  discussing this point now    This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation   Granted it s very rare  but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go   Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time       - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the      hammer for maximum safety  but still can be drawn and fired with an      easy motion  even one handed   Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended   A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off      - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines      on semi-autos  Can be faster depending on users   The best speedloader users  especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast   A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed   This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun  with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time   You also don t have the advantage of tactical reloads  replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later             - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell      first  time spent which can be fatal  And a vital second or so is often      lost as you realize  hey  it s jammed   before starting to do anything      about clearing it   Yes  the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it   Really though  in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small   You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns  Sigs  Glocks  et al         - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round      and cock the hammer  Some police carry their semi-autos with the       chamber loaded and hammer cocked  but a safety engaged  I do not consider      this safe however  You must trade-off safety to get the same speed      of employment as a revolver      - There are some double-action semi-autos out there  but the complexity of      operation of many of them requires more training   All common semi-auto s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems   While I put that out as a statement that I believe  I should say that this applies to all of the ones I ve looked at   For the DA semi s it s no different from the revolver situation   The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks   They also have a safety   Because there s no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver  plus the advantage of SA followup shots   I m not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1   I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked  but after examining the design  trying to defeat the safeties  gun unloaded of course   and  shooting it a lot  I see no inherent safety problems with it  especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer   This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver          Some police departments switched to Glocks  and then started quietly    switching many officers back to the old revolvers  Too many were having    accidents  partly due to the poor training they received  Not that Glocks    require rocket scientists  but some cops are baffled by something as complex    as the timer on a VCR   Yeah  the infamous Glock   I still can t figure out how it s worse than a revolver for safety   If you don t pull the trigger it doesn t go off   I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it   In addition  if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you d have problems when the hammer wasn t there          Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun    the police don t know nothing about firearms  Turn off COPS and Hunter    and pay attention  I do not seek here to say  semi-autos are junk     merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid  A cop    with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than    equipped for anything short of a riot   I think this is even okay for a riot  as long as it s a small one B             Gun control is hitting what you aim at  If you whip out a     wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything     Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit     I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon    to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver  If I haven t hit    what I m aiming at in the first 5 shots  something is quite seriously    wrong somewheres  While I might like having the backup capacity of those    extra shots in certain cases  overwhelmingly the   of shots fired in    criminal encounters is less than 5   I have the poor man s Beretta  Taurus 99  and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield  45  oops  9mm vs  45 arguments are relegated to r g    You are right  though   If you don t hit what you aim at then the shooter gun combination has failed   I don t ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun   This is a shooter failure  whether through lack of discipline or lack of training           What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime  Why the same nice simple     38 revolvers that the police often use  Well actually some police     prefer the much heftier  357 Magnum  but anyway       9mm s are becoming more popular with crooks too  though the  38 does still lead the list   And like I said  around here semi-auto s seem the rule for the street cop   Don t know about the State Patrol however  they may still carry the  Highway Patrolman           ObPlea  Don t flame me  I prefer semi-autos for most things  But they             introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking            as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal   Vincent  please don t take any of this as a flame   Just my  0 02  whoops  looks more like  2 00  worth   And much of it is IMHO  but do check Ayoob s book          --      If everything had gone as planned  everything would have been perfect       -BATF spokesperson on CNN 3 2 93  regarding failed raid attempt in TX  </snippet>

never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967   It   has been whether they fired their main guns     Never   This is incorrect   Either you don t read very well or resort to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point   At the risk of boring and belaboring the point  my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks  last used in Detroit in 48   The text follows      You did not merely claim that   tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress   sniper fire and that they were  quite  effective at this     Indeed  when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs  I did say I had been told they did fire their main guns                      You continue to   back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is   disputing   Well  the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48   Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody        Well  it s not the main gun    Gee  that s only the entire point   Are you   now going to admit that you were wrong   That was the entire point to  you    What exactly did I claim     --------------------------------------------------    I ve heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire   Quite effectively      --------------------------------------------------    I wasn t wrong       I ve heard those descriptions   If you re paying attention  I ve mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes  but the main gun firing was an account I heard   That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the  to use your words   bullshit filters    Stating that I  claimed  this is a falsehood     What was it I claimed as fact   Here s the entire post    --------------------------------------------------  We haven t used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948    Correction   I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968   I saw em  it was well covered in the news at that time   Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song  Black Day in July     --------------------------------------------------    Since you don t dispute that and claim that nobody else does  that means I was right       I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the  67   riots   There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place   without it being common knowledge even 26 years later   The American   military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have   been  big  news      So one would suppose   Some folks think in happened in 48     Awesley goes on    You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers     To fire fragmentary grenades   I doubt that as well   To fire concussion   grenades   Perhaps   To fire tear gas   Certainly   But you would be   perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags  wouldn t you  since   it makes your other claim seem more plausible   John  again  strawman techniques   Do you feel you re losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down   What I read said nothing about what they fired   And so I put nothing in there   If you need some help  let me know and I l take your side of this for a while   You re not scoring here  you re boring here      If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit  people would have been   screaming about it for the past two and half decades   I would know about   it       Glad to know you re such an expert   Nice to hear some an authority   I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened  you would have know it   Since you are such an authority  you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot  Some claimed 100  dead  others said 300   The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was  several    I ve also heard some things about that but I won t dare repeat them   You d assert that I claimed they were truth     Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up       Taking the tour after the riots  it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops   Or so I recall from 26  years ago   And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks  So it would have been an Army cover-up      Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt  some were in rubble   Based on what I remember  I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two     If your mind is open enough to believe that  well  good for you   I prefer   to live in reality    And here in reality  I find it hard to believe that   those tanks even had any shells  much less fired them      Given the level in destruction in Detroit  I m quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns      Now then  we ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read this far and all you ve managed to say is that you don t believe the account I cited     --John L  Scott                                    -- wes

writes   Overall Crime rate   It fell    just like that            Two questions   When was this  and do you have the relevant numbers    Please note  this is  not  in any way an indication I don t believe you or that you re not correct  but when the drop occured is relevant        Acquiring weapons in Norway   You can buy  almost  all kinds of weapons in Norway  BUT you must have a   permit  and a good reason to get the permit      If I would like to have a handgun  i would have to get an gun-licence from   the police and to be a member of a gun-club          The primary objection  beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do  is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected  It discriminates against the poor          Is self-defense considered appropriate  and if so  under what conditions    Are you allowed  for instance to get a gun for protection if you re going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened     The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and or  records of SERIOUS mental diseases          This has been suggested in the U S   and generally supported among gun owners   What many object to is that many  if not most  proposals contain a sort of  gotcha  clause which allows an arbitrary denial  even if you qualify in every way    Now  if a got my licence  I would have to be an active member of the gun  -club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun   It s a little like getting a drivers licence isn t it      You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to            At this point  it should be pointed out that in general a driver s licence in the U S  is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart   I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here   In the U S  it s a joke           But my usual objection is that you re discussing two different things   For instance  in the U S  a driver s license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road   It is not necessary to own one  or to operate it on private property   That is  the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government s legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands   A permit to own an automobile  for instance  which is far closer an analogy  would be a much harder thing to get past legally  since it wouldn t be based on making regulations on public property  but in restricting activity on private property                  Use of guns in crimes  in Norway    Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners  arms   for a long time  but these are rather the exeption   Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes  and mostly short   time befor the crime     Use of knives   It IS allowed to cary knifes in public  but not in your belt or  open    You  Americans  think it s ok to have a gun  but not to carry it open  in public -rigth             This varies  widely     One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U S  has fifty unique jurisdictions  where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another            Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives   Some allow concealed   Some prohibit both  or allow one or the other   And it can be either a state or local restriciton           Individual vs masses   Yes the individual is more important than the masses  but only to some  extent      Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses     What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of   all the others            The question must be asked   Is the right of  this  individual affecting the rights of this  other  individual   What we usually get is that the rights of this  group   meaning some individuals within this group  here defined as  people who own guns    are adversely affecting  the rights of some other group            If for instance   Bob  were using his gun to attack  Steve   you d have a point   But essentially what we re discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group  people who own guns  then some third person  perhaps in another  time zone  is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else s rights   It s like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one    The issue   I believe the issue is GUNS  and gun-legislation          The issue is crime  violence  and murder   The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those    We shouldn t mix weapons and items that can serve as one      IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME   But should it have to be like that            Of course not   It would be nice if we didn t have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us  But currently we don t have that option   Nor do I expect we will    Do you think it s wise to sell guns like candy  some states do                No state does   In any case  there s a limit to which the state may enforce it s  wisdom  on me   Freedom in general is an unwise concept   If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be  unwise  then freedom becomes a meaningless concept       If you believe it s smart neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think  it should be free to buy guns            I ll raise my hand against driver s licenses   As currently implemented they re a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of drivers   It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed  or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car          But  as I mentioned  they re two different things   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ  of Tenn  Div  of Cont  Education Info  Services

writes     If I would like to have a handgun  i would have to get an gun-licence from    the police and to be a member of a gun-club    The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and or   records of SERIOUS mental diseases    Now  if a got my licence  I would have to be an active member of the gun   -club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun   So  like  what do you do during those six months to be  active   My town has a similar requirement  and it s rather stupid   Before you can buy a handgun  you have to be an active member of a gun club  Well  how active can you be without a gun  chief   Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn t be abused by the government   But every time this is proposed  there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun   And we oppose this     It s a little like getting a drivers licence isn t it       You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to     Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US  is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners  I d think twice before using this analogy   Besides  the problem is criminal use of guns  not accidents    There are about 500 000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1 400 accidents    I don t think it s necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one   Just like the check  most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they couldn t be abused by the government   But  they already have   One state doesn t hold the courses  another doesn t  fund them  a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence  to those with political connections   Is this fair     Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes  and mostly short    time befor the crime   And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets  How many are borrowed  stolen  smuggled  bought on the black market     Use of knives    It IS allowed to cary knifes in public  but not in your belt or  open     You  Americans  think it s ok to have a gun  but not to carry it open   in public -rigth     Some states allow ONLY open carry   Some allow ONLY concealed carry  Some allow both   Some allow both  but require licenses for concealed  carry   All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good  then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing  Which means that they really don t have any objective reasons for  these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern     Scandinavians ARE  aggressive     We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners  but when we decide   to take action we DO     Hot-livered    I LOVE that expression   Here  we say  hot-headed       Individual vs masses    Yes the individual is more important than the masses  but only to some   extent       Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses      What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of    all the others     Typically  the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices   The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time  and they do this during the commission of a crime   POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else   It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs   Of course  it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun  but we don t feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just  pre-felons  waiting to commit crimes     We shouldn t mix weapons and items that can serve as one      I don t understand this sentence     IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME    But should it have to be like that     Life isn t fair   I shouldn t need a fire extinguisher either  or flood and theft insurance  or to lock the doors of my house and car  But pining for a better world won t do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one     Do you think it s wise to sell guns like candy  some states do         None of ours  I m sure     If you believe it s smart neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think   it should be free to buy guns     Frankly  I m not sure I know what good a driver s license does anyone  either   The people who drive safely never use it  and the people who  drive drunk  drive without it   However  a car is a good tool  but not one that protects my right to life  I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely     I m not a pacifist or anti gun     I would defend my home  loved ones and country  but I don t view guns as   neccities or toys    I HAVE done army service  and HAVE used a variaty of weapons  but wouldn t   want to have one for self defence or because they  feel good       The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally   It s whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do  I don t have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun  I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one  too  --   cdt rocket sw stratus com   --If you believe that I speak for my company  OR cdt vos stratus com        write today for

		<snippet>From  cdt sw stratus com  C  D  Tavares  Subject  Re   long   Gun Hearings Day in Massachusetts  April 7    This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there    Gun Owners Action League  our state rifle association  started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9 30  It was looking sparse  about 40 people  until the speaker began  whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost  and filled out the area something proud   Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke   One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state  while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of  election fraud  to hold their jobs   Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings  and telling people where to find their own representatives  and in too many cases  who they were    Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn t made it onto the official list   It seems a delegation of students from Simon s Rock of Bard College  alma mater of Wayne Lo  who shot up the place with an SKS late last year  was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident   The hearings were originally scheduled in the  large  Gardner Auditorium at 10 30  but that had been pre-empted by the Governor s hearings on the Framingham Eight  women in prison for killing abusive husbands  and seeking release    So we had until 1 30 to buttonhole our representatives  after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room   One of my representatives  staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy  He said   Oh  it must be gun hearings day again   The gun lobby is always so organized every year    I got a little pissed  and replied   I m not from the gun lobby -- I m from your district    At 12 30  your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse  where the pro-gunners weren t    Randy Price from the TV News was there  in his mirror reflective shades  talking to one of the anti-gun types  and several Simon s Rock anti-gun  close-the-loophole  protestors   Earlier  Randy had covered the GOAL rally    The room we had been assigned seated about 50   Remember  there were about 160 gun owners there  plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard   One of us had already reserved a seat  the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM   A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in   Soon after the debate started  a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else   Everyone who was there  inside and outside  got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills   Most of us signed up to  support GOAL s position  on  all bills    First  because of their time constraints  public officials got to testify   And first up was the bill that nobody had seen  the students had some curfew  I guess      Currently  Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state   Previously  the law was similar  but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts   The Simon s Rock folks called the current law a  loophole  and wanted it closed   Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his  SKS assault rifle   The second one  Hodgekiss  a co-sponsor  had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana  Wayne Lo s home state  with Missouri  and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff   Carr  from Gloucester  claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was  but he was lying  the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state  as strong as  that in Massachusetts   Since none of them do  that s that   Some of the things these two said were really offensive    In some of these other states  anyone can buy a gun as long as he s breathing    Oooooo     We have some very  very good gun laws in Massachusetts  if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws  we wouldn t be having this situation -- but they won t     Naughty  naughty    Next up was Boston city councilman Albert  Dapper  O Neill   He was there to testify pro-gun  but in some ways he was a liability   He s reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself  plus he s almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician   He badmouthed the ACLU  said violent criminals should be executed  and that if he were judge  he d give arrestees their  last rights   pun intended  on the spot  at which many of the gun owners applauded  which bothered me   He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals   He said this FOUR times  -   Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID  and confiscate all your guns  if someone had filed a restraining order against you    Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant  no hearing  no evidence  and no conviction -- just an accusation    Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it  and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying   I m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted    I haven t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn t a crook   Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years  instead of permanent as it is now   The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible   Revenue has nothing to do with it     Yeah  right    Apparently  some congressmen think we re stupid enough to swallow the argument that it s preferable to process 1 6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time   As usual  hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook   The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep  Caron and Sen  Jujuga  Jujuga didn t say much  he was a co-sponsor of both  restraining order  bills  but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn t let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged    He  was a co-sponsor of one of the  restraining order  bills as well    One of the younger reps on the committee  forgot his name  was vociferously pro-gun  somewhat embarrassingly so   His heart was in the right place  but his arguments seemed to be confined to   every year it s the same damn thing  you come in here with this crap     It s nice to have a friend on the committee  but he could have been more effective   At about 3 00  it was clear that the hall-jam couldn t continue  Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting  so the loudspeaker was disconnected   So they found a bigger hall upstairs   One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus  and so missed the  public  testimony  the other got a seat this time   Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago  left the state  and then returned without notifying them of his address change  He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there   Great quote   If you purchase a gun today  it will not get into the state computer system until 1999     This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card    Testimony was heard from several  battered women   one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20 s who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts   They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men   A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill  saying how 50 000 restraining orders were granted last year  and how these women needed to be protected   Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days  and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year   He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID   She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response   Then testimony against the bill was heard   Mike Yacino  who looks something like Einstein  got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence  that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right  man or woman   and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts  Atty  Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony   Other pro-gunners got up to testify   One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out  and that she countered by filing one against him   He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law  One of the junior reps noted that  this is America  and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected   Senator Jujuga reiterated this  saying that  people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care  but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order     Point and match  Senator    Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn t know his citizenship  expired every 5 years   and that a driver s license was a privilege  not a right like the right to keep and bear arms   A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system  and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings   Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed  and joking responded that he  too  favored public hangings   The speaker then responded   I ll make you a deal   You get me the rope  and I ll tie the noose    Next came public testimony on the Simon s Rock bill   A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo  and that  he wouldn t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside  without his evil gun   She said that the  loophole  should be closed to prevent something like this from  ever happening again    Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill  one of spilling tears for the good legislators   One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there   Many of them had T shirts on  saying   As long as one person can buy a gun in anger  none of us are safe -- support gun control    The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids  except for Caron  who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID    Only residents can get FID s   he said    How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off    Yacino and McNutt spoke again  this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters   Karen also noted that hunters in CT  NH  and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens   Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and  hell  even an CCW  as he had NO criminal or mental record   One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters  and thought it was  elitist    Another  Caron   said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had  FID-type  cards  so complying with all the laws of one s home state was  not enough    One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming   Everyone s out of step but Johnny    All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made  and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration   The main bills remaining  and GOAL s position  were   o  H 4375 and four others  Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted  strongly supported   o  H 1732  Require trigger locks on all handguns sold  opposed   o  H 962  Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms  strongly    opposed   o  H 1350  Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws      opposed   o  H 1731  Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police  supported   o  S 1097  State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA  supported   o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards  opposed   o  Several altering non-resident license conditions  supported   o  H 1135  Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state  guess    Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider  as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them   Mike Yacino noted that  besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun  that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked   Caron blew right through H 1350 when he saw that we opposed it  Again  he brought up the state s archaic records capability and said   This would create hundreds of different licensing systems    The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing  it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified   It ended at about 6 30  --   cdt rocket sw stratus com   --If you believe that I speak for my company  OR cdt vos stratus com

		<snippet>From  lvc cbnews cb att com  Larry Cipriani  Subject  DeConcini -- ten years ago and today   Dennis Deconcini  1982      In these and similar areas  the Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense  but of 5 U S C  Sec 552  which was intended to prevent  secret lawmaking  by administrative bodies     These practices  amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee  leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States     It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens     It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property     It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law     The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing  Richard Davis  speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department  asserted vaguely that the Bureau s priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators  particularly felons ille- gally in possession  and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime  He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities  No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions  In hearings before BATF s Appropriations Subcommittee  however  expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge  but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations      Exerpt from  97th Congress  2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT      T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S                                 REPORT                                 of the                    SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION                                 of the                       COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY                          UNITED STATES SENATE                         NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS                             SECOND SESSION                              FEBRUARY  1982         Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary                     U S  GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 88-618 O                         WASHINGTON   1982     Letter to Constituent  April 1993     Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  and Firearms  ATF   which is the Federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations    It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury  Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF  that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government  The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful  legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms  especially in the area of  drug-related crimes   It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an illegal activity   The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence  also  both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons    The Waco  Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession  automatics  semi-automatics  and machine-guns  in addition to bombs and other explosives    In virtually every gun case  ATF is asked to trace weapons through its  National Firearms Tracing Center  where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information   ATF is the Federal governments  firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants   ATF  working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U S  Attorneys  office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians   In addition  ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning  knowing from their source  inside  that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored    As you may be aware by now  Vernon Howell a k a  David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants   Unfortunately  ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and prepare for ATFs  entry into the compound   Once a hostage situation presented itself  the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations   In addition  and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians    Based on what I have learned about ATF s role in the Branch Davidian raid  I believe the agency acted responsibly   I am  however  deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult   I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement   In addition  ATF will conduct its  own review of the Waco operation   I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion    Sincerely    Dennis DeConcini Chairman Subcommittee on Treasury  Postal Service and General Government   April 7  1993   --  Larry Cipriani -- l v cipriani att com </snippet>

    Your average    17-45 year old male does not fall into the definition   You re right  the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males  and probably females under current interpretation       Therefore most   members of The Militia  the one the every gun advocate refers to  are   not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directly  The Amendment does nor refer to  well organized   it says  well regulated    I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how  well regulated  I am      mentioned in the amendment     If this amendment wanted to allow every member of The Militia to keep   and bear arms  why did it specificly mention a  well organized militia     in the SAME SENTENCE as the right to keep and bear arms   Correct   That s why the Right is reserved to the People   And that was to insure the People could form a  well regulated Militia   not a  well organized militia      It could be   argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last    part   If so  why was it include in the same atomic unit of written  What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument   Any moron can set h bar   C   1       instead of a separate sentence   Oh  I see what your question is  Why don t you read the federalist Papers         James Madison  Federalist Paper 41  regarding the  General     Welfare  clause    Nothing is more natural nor common than first     to use a general phrase  and then to explain and qualify it by a     recital of particulars    But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd   He only wrote it     The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with    the security of a free state   The Federalist Paper s mention of a   well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects   the security of a free state   All these examples are actions of a   very organized force  not some John Q  Public with a gun   That s obviously because you ve never actually  read  the Federalist Papers      All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me is that the people s   right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed   That is    people have the right to join a well organized militia   This well   organized militia will  of course  provide training in how to use arms   and in basic military tactics   These training members of the militia   can keep and bear the arms   Can t read  huh   Show me where the document says  well organized militia       Lastly  reading through the Federalist Paper s on well organized    militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias    One reason stated is the protection from a standing army   These days   the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every    17-45 year old male and female not in the armied forces   That is  exactly  why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own  any  weapon currently in use in the armed forces     Another   reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need   for a standing army   Well  the US Armied Forces have been a standing   army for more than half the history of the US   But the major reason is to protect against that very same army     It seems to me the whole reason for the Second Amendment  to give   the people protection from the US government by guaranteeing that the   people can over through the government if necessary  is a little bit   of an anachronism is this day and age   Maybe its time to re-think   how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately       Abraham Lincoln  First Inaugural Address  March 4  1861   This     country  with its institutions  belongs to the people who inhabit     it   Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government      they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it  or     their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it        Rep  Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts  spoken during floor debate     over the Second Amendment  I Annals of Congress at 750  17 August     1789   What  Sir  is the use of a militia   It is to prevent the     establishment of a standing army  the bane of liberty          Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of     the people  they always attempt to destroy the militia  in order     to raise an army upon their ruins    So now we know which category Mr  Rutledge is in  He means to destroy our Liberties and Rights   -- Charles Scripter       cescript phy mtu edu Dept of Physics  Michigan Tech  Houghton  MI 49931 -------------------------------------------------------------     when all government    in little as in great things  shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of all power  it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated     Thomas Jefferson  1821 </snippet>

		<snippet>From  viking iastate edu  Dan Sorenson  Subject  Re  Nuclear heavy weapons and the Militia  Long   fcrary ucsu Colorado EDU  Frank Crary  writes    Down to 170-some odd lines   We must be making progress  On an ironic note  where I deleted lines Emacs continually gave me the message  Garbage collecting    Done    Think it s trying to tell me something    viking iastate edu  Dan Sorenson  writes    And thank you  It s a great change from the same tired old debates      You lurkers can join in at any time  you know   Ahhh   Talk politics guns -- the kindler  gentler newsgroup   Who would have thought    No  not exactly  The only reason for this sort of restriction is  the possible endangerment of others  A poorly maintained   rifle is dangerous  but only to the user  since it doesn t  endanger others  there is no justification for such restrictions    I remind you of shrapnel   I consider 5  a reasonable space limitation  but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby  say in the next lane at the range   My point was at what distance  or level of threat  we draw the line   Is it the endangerment of others  so we do a 5  restriction  or the possibility of being shot  hence we draw a 1 5 mile restriction  or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction   To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user  Perhaps Sen  Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me  since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it    They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to  protect their homes and families  Using nuclear weapons close   to home will not accomplish this    I disagree  on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died   I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned   If this is not the case  the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit   Personally  my home is worth  say  twenty Martians intent on taking over the world   My family   All of them   The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk    There is  however  another problem  In any case of civil war   the strength of the militias fighting on each side should  reflect the popular will  If the public is split 67  versus  33   then the minorities  militias should be at a 2 1 disadvantage   Such a need for popular support would  hopefully  prevent   insurrections unless the people really were behind the rebels   But heavy weapons owned by a small fraction of the militia   could distort this  What if the 33  minority included all the  tank and artillery owners    That seems to be the case already  given that heavy weapons aren t commonly owned by the citizenry   With such low numbers  obviously due to cost  I don t think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe   Furthermore  it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks  whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness    I think it is vital to avoid such a situation  where a small   minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power  through violence  To prevent this  it may be necessary to give   control of heavy weapons  e g  those which only a small number  of individuals would own  and  whose firepower would grossly   distort the relation between popular support and military   strength  to someone other that individual militiamen  This is  certainly not a good thing  but I think it is the lesser of two evils   Whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body   responsive to the will of the people    I had envisioned that the armorer  perhaps the officers of a select group  and the like would exercise control over the heavier  more complex weapons   But  if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn t ask him to give it up   Follow orders from the officers  yes   Since the expense of a tank is so large  though  chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated    Here  I think we have to be carefull about  which   state  we  are talking about  Certainly one role of the militia is to  overthrow a repressive government  and it would be completely  destructive to that end for that same government to control   the militia s arms  But the United States have several levels  of government  each able to act independently  but not all  likely targets of rebelion   As such  rebelions against state and  local governments are very unlikely  I think  therefore  that the  state  or possibly local  governments could safely be allowed to  keep the select militia s heavy weapons  The risk of abuse  while  still something to consider  is far less than the similar risk  were the federal government in control    This I ll agree with to a point   The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located   Keep them spread out  such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn t so easy   Otherwise  I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers    That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed  The select  militia should privide the militia s heavy weapons and highly-trained  specialists  For the reasons I have outlines above  I think   these heavy weapons  tanks  artillery  aircraft  etc     are  better off being kept by local governments than by a small   number of individuals  However  local governments shouldn t  be able to use the select militia without the support to the  people  Ideally  the general militia  under the direct   control of the people  and the select militia  under the direction  of democratic  local governments  would opperate together   But even in the worst case  the general militia should be able  to functional without the select militia  Similarly  the  select militia should be incapable of action without the  aid of the general militia    I m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons  fairly few in numbers  could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support   Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn t have all of them  I can t see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry  I think a better mix is called for   But  I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units    Consider  then  the effect of removing the National Guard s  infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local  governments  The government-controled select militia could  not fight effectively without infantry support provided by  the general militia  an inherently infantry organization     On the other hand  the general militia could function  although  at a disadvantage  without the backing of local governments and  the select militia    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces  and if they ve all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble  I d like to see that heavy stuff  say tanks  offset by the local troups having a few 105 s and anti-tank weapons in their armory   These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in  I suppose I m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment        but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds   dikes in times of flood  sets up disaster relief cities  and   the like     I would much rather see these things handled by the local    general militias    So would I  but the resources often aren t available to outfit local units well enough   Thus  we will certainly have to call in others  and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else    Perhaps the National Guard isn t as close to my conception of  the select militia as I thought  I was considering them to   be the heavy weapons armor arm of the militia  not the infantry  arm of the regular army    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different   I think main battle tanks  self-propelled artillery  and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff   M113 troop carriers  2 1 2 ton trucks  HumVee s  old M60 tanks  105 Howitzers  are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry   Actually  this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units    Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control  with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent   Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks   Similarly  local units would need to band together quickly  hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry   Finally  the militia is more than just fighting   Equipment is needed for other responses   The Federal army  I m convinced  should have a very minumum of infantry  relying on the state and local militias for these functions     Dan Sorenson  DoD  1066 z1dan exnet iastate edu viking iastate edu      ISU only censors what I read  not what I say   Don t blame them

not  waiting for 51 days and pounding them with sound  etc      A bunch of dead BD members are not going to be so able to tell their   side of the story  so now all we have is the story according to the BATF   and FBI   Also  Mr  care about the rights of people  Clinton  or his   administration approved this action  FBI said  Washington had approved   it     They FBI said the gas masks used by the BDs have a finite life    and were close to running out   WHY COULDN T THEY HAVE JUST WAITED     Well  there are 9 people supposedly alive   They can tell their story   As far  as Bill Clinton is concerned don t you think he has more pressing matters to  attend to besides some small group of people in Texas   How about Bosnia   Now  there s a problem          Why couldn t they have waited   They waited too long  as it is   Something should have been done earlier         They gov is trying to say it was a mass suicide   In the past they had   expressed this was a real possibility  but now they decided it wasn t   a possibility so they could go on with the raid   Apparantly what they   feel Korash was or was not capable of or going to do was driven by   what was most convenient at the time         Now this means that       1  The public and media will forget about all this - having become weary of   it     This has already happened for many people      2  There will be no investigation  independent or otherwise  or a whitewash     Very much a possibility      3  There will be no unsealing of the warrant and related documents    4  What anybody will know about this incident will be the BATF version     With the way our government is I wouldn t doubt it      5  The BATF has just been given Carte Blanche for further abuses  with      the effective support and approval of the Administration     Clinton said on the news that he knew about what was happening but that it was  all in the hands of the FBI   That is if you choose to believe the media      6  There WILL BE more abuses  with no concern of Administration censure    7  The precident has been established that the Feds can kill in quantity      to achieve their aims   Especially if the target is excercising their      rights under the Second Amendment  and the rest of the Bill of Rights       and is a government-declared un-nice fellow     If they had rocket launchers and such  as the press and gov claims  why  shouldn t they have done something   What possible use would a religious cult  have for a rocket launcher   Also  is child abuse covered by the Bill of  Rights         LLs and CLAMs will be pleased   Dung Tsow Ping sp  will be pleased       Saddam Hussein sp  will be pleased   Idi Amin would be pleased   Stalin      would be pleased   Even Hitler would be pleased   Any self-respecting      despot would nod and say  Well Done  Bill Clinton        Well  then there are probably a lot of self-respecting despots in the US cause  I m sure they feel the same way      God Bless America - Land of the Free      past tense        Well  maybe I AM overreacting   But I see on the TV as I am typing where    Maybe  maybe not   There are a lot of questions that should be raised about  this incident   The problem is  who will do it and be heard      govt spoksewoman  the new attorney general  known to be almost rabid   about private ownership of guns - wants to ban  assault guns  and just   about everything else   is saying the FBI had  amazing restraint   then   falls back into the official goverenment line about how the BD were   guity of child abuse  and were into it in an on-going basis  and so on    Note that according to the Liberal Elite  giving a child a spanking is   regarded as child abuse  seriously - if it gets known  the STATE can   take your child away from you if you spank your kid    She also is saying    Which state is that   The federal government  or an individual state government        CLINTON PERSONALLY APPROVED THIS OPERATION - she  told him it was   appropriate and so on  and he SAID OK  DO IT    Somehow  I am not   surprised - the people MUST KNOW WHO IS BOSS - WHO IS IN CHARGE      And it is obviouly no longer the people      It seems to me that the people haven t been in charge for a long time   If they  really were I don t think the government would be doing as many things as it  has in the past      And I maintain the appropriate response  as far as this raid by BATF is   concerned  regarding child abuse is  so what     BATF are not our Child   Protective Services Police   Yet   After all the BD had been TRIED on   that charge before and found NOT GUILTY   The gov t people have pretty   much gone silent on the terrible illegal guns BD supposedly has  and   stress the  continued child abuse   apparantly to make it a seem as sort   of a  rescue  operation  figuring everyone hates child abusers  and   anything is OK to use against them    Occasional references to ammunition   possesed by the BDs and so on is irrelevant  it is NOT ILLEGAL to have   ammunition  yet       True but is it illegal to have a rocket launcher      Am I having a vain hope that an honest investigation will occur on this   thing   Or will it simply be whitewashed under the rug  and Business   as Usual will continue to be the Order of the Day in the New Order    Who will be given the official title of  Thought Police   I wonder          And if Clinton and friends have their way   highly likely at this point    the New Order Government will also have all the guns     So what if    1984  is going to be ten years late     I think we are going to discover   that we will be paying DEARLY for putting this fellow in office for decades   to come   Even some die-hard supporters are having serious doubts about   their Savior      Shit  if people dont get what they want right away there is an instant problem   Clinton has only been in office for a few months   Give him a chance to get  something done   The guy had a lot of shit thrown in his lap in the beginning   Give him a chance to work on things a little   As they say - Rome wasn t built  in a day      Yes  I am UPSET   I see NO GOOD as far as civil individual rights to   come of any of his proposals decisions for the last month or so      We have really been HAD   Or Bill of Rights is now nothing but a quaint   curiosity      I highly doubt that it is that bad yet   How about the Rodney King trial   The  two people who were most responsible got the axe   How bad the axe falls tho  is yet to be seen      Anybody for impeachment      Nope    I would prefer to give Bill a little more than four or five months to  solve the nations problems    --   pat rwing uucp       Without prejudice UCC 1-207       Pat Myrto  Seattle  WA            If all else fails  try            uunet pilchuck rwing pat   WISDOM   Only two things are infinite  the universe and human stupidity             and I am not sure about the former                -

		<snippet>From  cathy LANCE ColoState Edu  Cathy Smith  Subject  WEIRD SCIENCE -- by L  Neil Smith  Posted by Cathy Smith for L  Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying   his lips  move   What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase   political science  is subject to more than one interpretation     Years ago  we heard how  scientists  were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming  and later on that  nuclear winter  -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility   Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs     What we didn t hear was that no actual data supported any of this   that real-world events  the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields  tended  to discredit it  that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history   and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together  exposing them to new germs     We miss a lot like this  unless we listen closely   Prince William  Sound  site of the famous oil spill  and Mount St  Helen s weren t  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years   That turned out not to be true  although you d never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN   It doesn t fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient  and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be     But for once  the media aren t entirely to blame   As ignorant of  science as they are of everything  they trust  scientists  to  unscrew the inscrutable   The trouble is that today s  scientists   have agendas of their own     Nobody in government  that wellspring of scientific wherewithal  is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for  global warming    The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit  and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable     The same appears true of  acid rain   a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency  which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car  and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much     The list goes on  always with a common  disreputable thread     Ozone depletion   for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming  is no more than  a last  desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final  withered leg to teeter on     Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism  resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering  have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest  cleanest  most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point  that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society  the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become     Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts  but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed  most recently by the California state government     And what the media didn t say about recent EPA  discoveries  on the  effect of  secondhand smoking  is that  although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected  it was less  by an order or two of  magnitude  than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird   It s enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer     That  of course  is the real threat represented by politically  correct science   The world is a dangerous place   It would be nice  to know the hazards   I ve never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice  but  given a lack of credibility on the part of today s  science  how am I to decide what to do about it   Nicotine is  highly addictive  to that much I can attest from experience   Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue   There  isn t any way to tell  thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment     Two centuries ago  the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another  by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion   Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier  most recently over the issue of  abortion   blood -- real human blood  hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed     Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues  as people s  lives are ruined through the loss  to agencies like the EPA  of  livelihood  or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate   to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power  or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates   when they die from the effects of obesity     What we need now  if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries  is another barrier  a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine   Knowledge is valuable   real science won t languish for lack of funding   The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies  and  everyone will benefit     L  Neil Smith Author   THE PROBABILITY BROACH  THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE  HENRY MARTYN   and  forthcoming  PALLAS LEVER ACTION BBS  303

		<snippet>From  jgd dixie com  John De Armond  Subject  FBI Murders  was Re  ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN    jmd cube handheld com  Jim De Arras  writes    I have believed all along that they could not let them live  the   embarrassment  to the BATF and the FBI would ve been too severe    Remember  this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant   There were no    witnesses  except the FBI   All information filtered through the FBI   All   they had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed   near the  building  and the press could ve done their job  and would ve   been able to back the FBI s story with close up video  while incurring no   risk to the press   Unless they did not want the public to see something     The complete lack of any  other source of information other than the   FBI really causes me concern     Sick to my stomach  and getting sicker from all the Government apologists  Well put  Jim   I am as concerned about the media s complicity in this growing coverup   Can you imagine the media outrage  the lawsuits  the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story   Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it   What s going on here   Let s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next  I m a student of human phychology  particularly in the area of psy-ops because I ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business negotiations   That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks   This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on him   You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh   Koresh s behavior was emminently predictable   It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation   It would also be typical  given Koresh s religious orientation  for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the apocalypse   Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the apocalypse   IMHO  the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse   I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting reasonably   They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations  They KNEW that sending tanks  oops  combat engineering vehicles  obstensibly to perform  gas insertions   love that NewSpeak  WOULD push him over the edge   Look at some supporting evidence   Koresh s attorney mentioned on TV earlier today  4 20  that one of Koresh s major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the compound   The FBI  through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning  claimed to have listening devices in the compound   If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink   They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide   Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would  at the first sign of preparations for suicide  have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor   Instead they continued with the  gas insertion  right up to the point where flames appeared   The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound  gloating over the kill   Let s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without bloodshed   This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence   The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back  abandoned the assault  torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor  maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him out   Exploiting his ego would have been simple   A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have resisted   He could have then been nabbed when he left the compound   Simple  clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought  it was totally out of the question   Not without all that testesterone floating around   After all Jannet Reno had to show the world how big her balls are   Yesterday was a sad  sad day for the American system   I am sick to my  very soul   John --  John De Armond  WD4OQC                Interested in high performance mobility

sharp  in tone   I have been writting reasonable and polite letters to him for years  and all I get in return in the HCI party line   Since he already is NRA F rated  I don t think that upsetting him will harm the cause   Sorry if you disagree  but recent events in Texas REALLY have me pissed   -------------------        April  20  1993 Representative Skaggs   Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms   BATF   in Texas   In your response you stated that  Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians  My question to you is   what grounds would you use to deny them access to  firearms    Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total ignorance of the subject  and highlights your personal bias against firearms  I say this because there are only two possible paths of  gun control  which you could have been referencing   Either  1  You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms   In this case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of this Country  including Texas and Colorado   In addition the members of the  cult  have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability to purchase these weapons   So under what grounds would you deny them these guns   Their religion   The fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves   Because you consider them to be a cult   Maybe I consider your Church to be a cult   This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of  thought crimes    You and Pat Robertson should really get along   2  You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the  cult    Under current US law  FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation   So if David Koresh illegally possessed them  he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest laws we have   How will more laws help   By the way  it has been reported that David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted  him to possess FULLY automatic weapons   If true  the 85 people who perished Monday in the fire  died so that the Federal government could collect a couple hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn t declare   I have heard claims that they were  stockpiling weapons    Yet considering the number of people in the complex  even 200  weapons would not have been out of line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas   What s next   A siege of Dallas Ft Worth for alleged  stockpiling    Face it David Skaggs  You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that has passed through Congress  yet you claim that you are only for  reasonable  restrictions   Bull        Handgun Control Inc  is struggling to maintain 250 000 PAID members  while the NRA has just exceeded 3 000 000

		<snippet>From  betz gozer idbsu edu  Andrew Betz  Subject  Randy Weaver trial update  Day 5   Note  These trial updates are summarized from reports in the  Idaho Statesman  and the local NBC affiliate television station  KTVB Channel 7   Randy Weaver Kevin Harris trial update  Day 5   Monday  April 19  1993 was the fifth day of the trial   Synopsis  Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934   U S  District Court Judge Edward Lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver Harris case   The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently ended without further incident  as it was mentioned neither by KTVB nor the  Idaho Statesman    The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley  who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named Gus Magiosono   Fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  and Firearms in his dealings with Randy Weaver   Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake  Idaho   The two then met again October 11  1989  note the huge separation in time  at a restaurant in Sandpoint  Idaho  to begin a weapons transaction   He stated that Weaver had said   He felt like he  Weaver  was being prepared to do something dangerous for the White cause    The two later met October 24  1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale   During this second meeting  Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation   Weaver allegedly showed him an H R 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of 19 25 inches   He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12 75-inch barrel and an overall length of 24 5 inches  NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches    On tape  Weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up   The two then discuss the possibility of future sales   Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet    Note that the ATF could have simply arrested him here   Why did they wait until January 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him   This is not explained    The next meeting took place on Nov 30  1989   Fadeley stated that his  source  had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he d promised   At this point  Weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant   I had a guy in Spokane tell me you were bad    Fadeley managed to convince Weaver otherwise   The  Idaho Statesman  states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with Randy Weaver   Thus  each of these meetings must have been recorded   However  the  Statesman  also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki Weaver  Randy Weaver s wife  was played to the court   There must have also been phone taps   These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence  Weaver s attorney   Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case      if it has a case at all     according to the rules   Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife s voice on the tape   U S  District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver Harris case   Exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained   Other notes  Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning Kevin Harris   Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive   First  they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound s  sustained in the initial firefight at the Y-junction   Later  when Randy Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that Harris had been struck  not Weaver    Finally  there was a report that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming at Kevin Harris instead    This is what was reported    Critics are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and Deputy Marshal William Degan   Some local people believe that Harris s survival is simply due to divine intervention   Tuesday  April 20  1993 will be the sixth day of the trial   Kenneth Fadeley s testimony is scheduled to continue    </snippet>

Message-ID   y52n tc mvp netcom com   Date  Thu  17 Sep 92 23 42 42 GMT  Organization  Netcom - Online Communication Services  408 241-9760 guest   References   swood 716099748 vela   Lines  84    Along the lines of  The Armed Citizen   here s a story that  some of you may find amusing   It s a story about Arizona  house-hunting  from Leslie Fish  musician and author       ----           One of the reasons I m planning to move to Arizona is that --  despite its lousy economy  4-way race problems  simmering religious  problems and hopelessly bad government -- Arizona has one of the lowest  violent- crime rates in the country  Is it just coincidence that  Arizona is also one of the few remaining no-gun- control states in the  country         Well  consider this funny story  Last time I was in Phoenix   staying with Liz Burnham  I did some checking on the local real-estate  market  that s when I discovered that  with my income -- as provable by  my tax returns -- I can qualify for every low-income housing loan in  the book  with the exception of VA   and I came across an astonishing  ad in the local market-paper  It offered a three-bedroom house in the  Phoenix area for -- are you ready for this -- all of  10 000  No money  down   100 per month total payments  Christ on a Harley-Davidson  I  called up the real-estate office making this offer  made it clear that  I was only checking the local market  and asked about that house  Were  the walls  roof and foundation structurally sound  Yes  Were the  plumbing and electrical systems functional and up to code  Yes  Did the  air-conditioning system  an absolute necessity in Phoenix  work   Yes   again   Okay  so what was wrong with the house   Well  it needed lots  of plastering  painting  yard work  and some patching of the roof --  and yes  low-interest repair loans were available   Okay  sez I  If  that s all that s wrong with it  just why are you selling a 3-bedroom  house for all of  10 000  Well  squirms the agent  it s in kind of a  bad neighborhood  How bad  sez I  remembering some of the neighborhoods  I ve seen in Chicago and Oakland   Worst in the city  the agent sighs   and then he told me this amazing story         Every few years  it seems  the big vice-gangs in Los Angeles notice  that there s no gang presence in Phoenix -- which is just a quick  5-hour drive from LA -- and get the idea of setting up a subsidiary  there  Well  a couple years ago  the colonizing force came to this  neighborhood -- it being poor and Spanish  they figured they could move  right in and take over -- bought this house and started operations   Unfortunately for them  the neighbors not only didn t like this -- they  didn t care for whores trotting up and down their streets all night   pimps soliciting their kids  dope- deals on the corners in broad  daylight  and so on -- they weren t afraid to do something about it   The neighbors called the cops  for some reason  the Phoenix police are  remarkably honest  capable  polite and prompt   and the cops promptly  came and swept up all the whores  pimps and pushers off the street and  away to jail  The remaining gang members decided to retaliate in the  fashion they usually use in LA  they got the complainant s name and  address off the court records  and did a drive-by shooting at his  house   Well  this wasn t Los Angeles  The moment the neighbors heard  the first gunshots fired  they all ran out their front doors with their  own guns -- rifles  shotguns  pistols  everything -- and shot back         The car didn t make it to the end of the block  It coasted to a  stop  riddled with more holes than the famous Bonnie and Clyde getaway  car  which I ve seen  it s on display in a casino in a casino in Las  Vegas    The gas tank and fuel lines had been ruptured  so the car  caught fire  The neighbors waited a good 15 minutes -- making sure  nobody got out of that car -- before they called the fire department to  come put out the fire and tow the wreck away  By that time  the asphalt  under the car had melted and caught fire too  which subsequently left a  large and nasty pot-hole in the street  The city is slow about  repairing small streets  so the hole stayed there providing a traffic  hazard for several months  All this was two years ago  the agent  concluded  and there s been no trouble since  but the house and the  neighborhood still have a bad reputation -- and that s why the house  was so cheap         Hearing this story  I nearly laughed my ass off  I told the agent  that if I had the money at the moment  I d by-god buy the house  this  was  nothing  compared to bad neighborhoods I d seen here in  California  where drive-by shootings go unchecked by the well-armed  cops  let alone by the unarmed neighbors  If that s the absolute worst  you ll find in Phoenix  then that s the city for me         That s the difference that an armed civilian population makes   Think about it       --   Mike Van

--------------------------------------------------      I ve heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns   to respond to sniper fire   Quite effectively        --------------------------------------------------        I wasn t wrong       I ve heard those descriptions   If you re   paying attention  I ve mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own   eyes  but the main gun firing was an account I heard   That helps   people judge whether or not to kick in the  to use your words     bullshit filters    Stating that I  claimed  this is a falsehood     Later in the same post       Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building   were burnt  some were in rubble   Based on what I remember  I was and   am inclined to believe an old sarge or two   Fine   now  you are stating that you believe their claims  or that you are  inclined  to   See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs    Those claims are still ludicrous  however   Previously Awesley had written    You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers   Prompting me to write    To fire fragmentary grenades   I doubt that as well   To fire concussion   grenades   Perhaps   To fire tear gas   Certainly   But you would be   perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags  wouldn t you  since   it makes your other claim seem more plausible   To which Awesley replied    John  again  strawman techniques   Do you feel you re losing it so you   have to stretch what I said and knock that down   What I read said   nothing about what they fired   And so I put nothing in there   If you   need some help  let me know and I l take your side of this for a   while   You re not scoring here  you re boring here   But why did you mention grenade launchers at all   Because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled buildings   And it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades   But that too is ludicrous   I wrote    If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit  people would have been   screaming about it for the past two and half decades   I would know about   it    Awesley relied       Glad to know you re such an expert   Nice to hear some an   authority   I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it   had happened  you would have know it   Since you are such an   authority  you probably know that people did scream about an alleged   massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot    Some claimed 100  dead  others said 300   The offical number is 43 but   the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was  several    I ve also   heard some things about that but I won t dare repeat them   You d   assert that I claimed they were truth   Yes  if it happened I would have heard about it   Everybody would have   Army tanks don t fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960 s without it becoming common knowledge  without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again  without civil libertarians saying  this has gone far enough    So  yes  my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the claim   Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it   Not one poster has written to say  yes  I lived in Detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells   This is the UseNet   If it had happened  somebody here would remember it   Furthermore  your own research failed to come up with any support for the claim   The claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence  extraordinary or not   Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit   I do not   I wrote    Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up    Awesley wrote       Taking the tour after the riots  it was pretty easy to tell the    difference between Army and Guard troops   Or so I recall from 26    years ago   And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks    So it would have been an Army cover-up   Quibble   Fine  it was an Army cover-up   Six years in the Reserves has taught me the difference also   But do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said  yes  I shelled Americans   or  I gave the orders to fire the cannons   or  I helped cover it up    I wrote    If your mind is open enough to believe that  well  good for you   I prefer   to live in reality    And here in reality  I find it hard to believe that   those tanks even had any shells  much less fired them   Awesley replied      Given the level in destruction in Detroit  I m quite willing to believe   that they did fire their guns   Good   Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did   Your belief fails a basic reality check  why isn t it known   Awesley concludes       Now then  we ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read   this far and all you ve managed to say is that you don t believe the   account I cited   Actually  now we have established that I don t believe what you believe  as well as why I don t believe it   And if it s boring  then I yield the last word to you  if you want it   You may say anything you like with impunity--I am dropping the subject   --John L  Scott </snippet>

-    This mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me   According -    to the Federalist Paper s  a well regulated militia has a well defined  -    structure and follows nationally uniform regulations  -   -  Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers    Perhaps you should  reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the  well regulated malitia    Here is what is says about its character     To oblige the great body of the yeomanry  and of the other classes   of the citizens  to be under arms for the purpose of going through   military exercises and evolutions  as often as might be necessary to   acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the   character of a well-regulated militia    It also talks about the  well regulated militia  having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline     I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states        Little more can reasonably be aimed at  with  respect to the people at large  than to have them properly armed  and equipped  and in order to see that this be not neglected  it  will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of  a year   But  do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year   Just to try to get the same people every year  provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force  and find a suitable location  it  requires a continually standing committee of organizers     Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline  and meet once or twice a year to train  how can you claim a  well regulated militia  is not well organized   But I will concide  a  well organized militia  is not necessarily a  well regulated militia     Several people have stated that the  well organized militia  is what is defined under 10 USC 311  which states   The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied   males at least 17 years of age and  except as provided in   section 313 of title 32  under 45 years of age who are    or who have made a declaration of intention to become    citizens of the United States and of female citizents of   the United States who are commissioned officers of the   National Guard   This deos define the militia  but were is the adjective  well regulated   10 USC 311 does not define a  well regualed militia  in any way  shape   or form   It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the  well regualed militia  as a proper SUBSET of the militia   In the same paragraph quoted above  it talk above  disciplining all the militia of the United States  so they fit the  character of a well-regulated militia    This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs    It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor   of the country  to an amount which  calculating upon the   present numbers of the people  would not fall far short   of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all   the States  To attempt a thing which would abridge the   mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent   would be unwise  and the experiment  if made  could not   succeed  because it would not long be endured    Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is  James Madison  Federalist Paper 41  regarding the  General Welfare  clause      Nothing is more natural nor common than first  to use a general phrase  and then to explain and qualify it by a  recital of particulars    So the phrase  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall  not be infringed  must either qualify or explain the phrase  a well  regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state     The definition of  explain  as stated in  The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language  The New College Edition  1982 is   1  To make plain or comprehensible  remove obscruity from      elucidate   It was the economists who undertook to explain      this puzzle   2  To define  explicate  expound  He explained his plan   3  To offer reasons for or a cause of  an answer for  justify      explain an error The second phrase clearly does not  explain  the first  therefore the second phrase must  qualify  the first   The definition given for  qualify  is   1  To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities     of  characterize   2  To make competent or suitable for office  position  or      task   3  To give legal power to  make legally capable   4  To modify  limit  or restrict  as giving exceptions   5  To make less harsh or severe  moderate  6  Grammar  To modify the meaning of  a word or phrase  Since  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall not be infringed  does not describe  modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task  By process of elimination it must fall into definition  3   And since  3 deals with legal power  the same thing the Constitution does  it must be the correct definition in this case   Therefore   the right  of the people to keep and bear Arms  gives legal power to the  well  regualated militia  and this legal power  shall not be infringed      I thank you very much Mr Scripter  you have provided me with more  evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the  people s right to form well regulate militia  and says very little  about the right of an untrained person to  keep and bear  a  50 caliber machine gun   And since I  totally untrained in the use of any firearm  something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun safety course and joining a gun club   cannot legally buy such a machine gun  I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me   -  So now we know which category Mr  Rutledge is in  He means to destroy -  our Liberties and Rights   I mean  to destory our Liberties and Rights    Is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what  our Libertues and Rights  are   I  force my version of  our Liberties and Rights  by begining statements of what  our Liberties and Rights  with  All that the Second Amendment  clearly states to me     Using expressions  such as  states to me    clearly mean I intend to force my views on others   I don t think so   So in effort not to force my views and not  to destory our Liberties and Rights    I state that nothing I have written  or will write  in the matter of  Liberties and Rights  is the final word   For I am only one person among many and the final word on  Liberties and Rights  cleary and irrevocably belongs to the many     ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------------

		<snippet>From  syck5280 miller cs uwm edu  Steven B Syck  Subject  WI and IL firearms law Questions    A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there     Question  1  According to the NRA ILA state firearms lawbook  in Wisconsin it is  unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed  with a   concealed and dangerous weapon    There is no statutory provision for obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon       Jury instructions indicate that  to go armed  one must have a firearm on one s person or within his immediate control and available for use     Does this mean that open carry is allowed   If so  just how  open  does it have to be   Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing   What if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon   Also  is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed  or is it just not allowed  period    Question  2  As I understand it  in Evanston  IL  they have a ordinance banning handguns  Is there any way to get around this provision   What would the penalty if you were found out be   What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there   How would the city law apply to your impending  trial for the shooting  Also  what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons   Short barreled shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available   either that or a shortened 9mm carbine  ie Colt  Marlin     One more thing  what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being rich or famous or related to the mayor   Please send replies via E-Mail  as things seem to be piling up around t p g a little faster than I can handle   Thanks again  -------   Steve Syck        syck5280 miller cs uwm edu        --------  </snippet>

		<snippet>From  dnewcomb whale st usm edu  Donald R  Newcomb  Subject  Re  Some more about gun control     First  I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as Mr  Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic  Frankly  most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the writings of the era  This  is most refreshing   Second  I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days  My brigade s quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the State Militia   Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro- nism that is out of place in the 20th century  I m not sure the Swiss would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia  both organized and unorganized  fits into the defense plans of my State  Mississippi  Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state  For instance  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a well organized Militia which  members report  maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns  The laws of other States will vary but are probably similar   Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as  all able-bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen  17  and sixty- two  62  years      The Militia is divided into 3 classes  The National Guard  the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia   The National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective  It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve  The discussion of this  para-constitutional  arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion  Suffice it that  at this date  the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing as anything but a Federal reserve force   Mississippi  and most other States  maintains a purely State organized Militia  In Mississippi this is called The State Guard  In other  States it may be called something else  The State Guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation  We drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level  brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization  Our State-authorized cadre strength is 694  This is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh  The muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized Militia   In time of invasion  insurrection or calamity the Governor can order the activation of the State Guard  When this takes place a call will first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910  In the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer  the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized Militia  The size of the State Guard is not specified by law  but rather by executive order  At one time  the organized Militia of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments  Needless to say  the State does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force  The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen    It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim    No  I simple stated that the people have a right to  join a well  organized militia    And I have also stated that a militia that  meets once or twice a year is clearly  well organized    And this  state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a  right   to  is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated  by Hamilton    Regarding Hamilton  If you take Hamilton s opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers  you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set  Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist end of the political spectrum  Others  such as Coxe and Henry  can be chosen to represent the other end  Many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia or  train bands  were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- ment they were striving to perfect  The compromise reached was to provide for a small Army  which had to be refinanced every two years  and iron-clad protection for the Militia  which was to remain ever   terrible and irresistible    These protections included  State control  not Federal  limitation of Federal utilization of the Militia  i e  execute Laws  suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions   and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington  These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern- ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard   The National Guard was created for one very simple reason  the  Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion   e g  Spanish-American War   The Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by the Federal government in very limited purposes  As far back as the War of 1812  Militia units had refused to leave United States territory to attack the enemy  Further  there was no Constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal Military and Militiamen were particularly protected  In all wars until WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer  When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the Army  existing soldiers were  grandfathered   At least one of these  grandfathered  individuals refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the Federal Courts   Mr  Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to members of a  well organized  militia  However  the pre-Constitutional history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs  Rutledge or Hamilton s definition of  well organized   In the period of peace between the French   Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution  Perhaps Mr  Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn t drill for a few years in the 1760s  I would not be so bold   Again  I wish to repeat  The National Guard  for all its merits  is not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr  Hamilton nor by Mr  Henry nor by Mr  Coxe  The fact that the Federal Government and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the Constitution    Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution  The Constitution prohibits States from keeping  Troops or Ships of War in time of Peace   I have heard some insist this prevents States from maintaining a Militia  but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage  Today we call any large vessel a  ship  but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel   A  ship  is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails  A  brig  has two masts  In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day  those capable of global operations  Today s equivalent might be a prohibition on the States  keeping nuclear missiles   Troops  at this time meant a full-time professional military organization  Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out    In at least one respect  I am in agreement with Mr  Rutledge  being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society  I am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State s Militia  --  Donald R  Newcomb                University of Southern Mississippi dnewcomb

		<snippet>From  ndallen r-node hub org  Nigel Allen  Subject  WACO  Clinton press conference  part 1  Here is a press release from the White House    President Clinton s Remarks On Waco With Q A  To  National Desk  Contact  White House Office of the Press Secretary  202-456-2100     WASHINGTON  April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press   1 36 P M  EDT       THE PRESIDENT   On February the 28th  four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound  which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition  and placed innocent children at risk  Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective  a 51-day standoff ensued        The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life   The Bureau s efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing  David Koresh  was dangerous  irrational  and probably insane        He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency   He was  moreover  responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February   Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages  no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound        This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI  designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully  The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition  even in the face of fire  and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health  but would  it was hoped  force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender        I was informed of the plan to end the siege   I discussed it with Attorney General Reno   I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask   I then told her to do what she thought was right  and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision        Yesterday s action ended in a horrible human tragedy  Mr  Koresh s response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives  as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive   He killed those he controlled  and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued        Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future   I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why  and whether anything could have been dne differently   I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation   I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review   Finally  I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people        I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General  to the Justice Department  and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances        Again  I want to say as I did yesterday  I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco   I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks   And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now        Q  Mr  President  can you  first of all  tell us why  after 51 days  you decided --       Q  Mr  President  can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --       THE PRESIDENT   I can t hear you both   If one will go first and then the other        Q  Sorry   Can you describe what Janet Reno --       Q  Mr  President --       THE PRESIDENT   I ll answer both your questions  but I can t do it at once        Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it        THE PRESIDENT   Yes   I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound   And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children  but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building   And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside        I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon   They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire   In fact  as you know  an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials  There were no shots coming back from the government side        I asked a number of questions   The first question I asked is  why now   We have waited seven weeks  why now   The reasons I was given were the following        Number one  that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there   They might be needed in other parts of the country        Number two  that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before  and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out        Number three  that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase  not decrease  with the passage of time        And number four  that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly  as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions        So for those reasons  they wanted to move at that time  The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good   She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time        The third question I asked was  has the military been consulted   As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco  that s the first thing I asked to be done  because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation   Military people were then brought in  helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it    And so I asked if the military had been consulted   The Attorney General said that they had  and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance        Having asked those questions and gotten those answers  I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do  that she should proceed and that I would support it   And I stand by that today        Q  Mr  President --       THE PRESIDENT   Wait   Go ahead        Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely  television  radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster        THE PRESIDENT   No  I m bewildered by it   The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody   It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold        There was -- I have -- I can t account for why people speculated one way or the other  but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place   I talked to her yesterday  I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show  and I talked to her again this morning   A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control        I will say this  however   I was  frankly  surprised would be a mild word  to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves    Applause         I regret what happened  but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance   These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty   They were heavily armed   They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly  and they were never fired back on   We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life   They made the decision to immolate themselves   And I regret it terribly  and I feel awful about the children        But in the end  the last comment I had from Janet Reno  is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said  now  I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more   And she said  it s because of the children   They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they re in increasingly unsafe conditions  and that they don t think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time   I have to take their word for that   So that is where I think things stand        Q  Can we assume then that you don t think this was mishandled in view of the outcome  that you didn t run out of patience   And if you had it to do over again  would you really decide that way        THE PRESIDENT   No -- well  I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today   This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time   This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split  record time   We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way   Is there something else we should have known   Is there some other question they should have asked   Is there some other question I should have asked   Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different   I don t know that   That s why I want the inquiry and that s why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people  not political people  but totally non-political  outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have        There is  unfortunately  a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world   And we may have to confront it again   And I want to know whether there is anything we can do  particularly when there are children involved   But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves        Q  Mr  President  were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday        THE PRESIDENT   Well  yes  I got regular reports all along the way   There were lots of other options pursued   If you go back -- you all covered it very well   The FBI -- you did a very good job of it   I mean  the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way  and a lot of them early on seemed to be working   Some of the children got out  some of the other people left   There was a -- at one point  there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities   And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward        Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday  the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this  because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves  That s what they thought        Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks        Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that        THE PRESIDENT   That s up to the Congress   They can do whatever they want   But I think it s very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts   And as I said in my statement  if any congressional committees want to look into it  we will fully cooperate   There is nothing to hide here   This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country       more  more   -30- </snippet>

The Second Amendment is a guarantee of the right to bear arms   Clearly     and unequivocally  without infringement       Unfortunately the Second Amendment is not as clear as you state   If last     part of it is taken along  it follows what you have said   The problem    I have is with the first part of the single sentence which makes up the    amendment   The Second Amendment is        A well

mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me   According    to the Federalist Paper s  a well regulated militia has a well defined     structure and follows nationally uniform regulations     Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers          James Madison  Federalist Paper 46   Besides the advantage of      being armed  which the Americans possess over the people of almost      every other nation  the existence of subordinate governments  to      which the people are attached  and by which the militia officers      are appointed  forms a barrier against the enterprises of      ambition  more insurmountable than any which a simple government      of any form can admit of   Notwithstanding the military      establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe  which are      carried as far as the public resources will bear  the governments      are afraid to trust the people with arms                                                        James Madison  I Annals of Congress 434  8 June 1789   The right      of the people to keep and bear    arms shall not be infringed   A      well regulated militia  composed of the body of the people                                                                       trained to arms  is the best and most natural defense of a free      country            Alexander Hamilton  Federalist Paper 29  on the organization of      the militia    Little more can reasonably be aimed at  with      respect to the people at large  than to have them properly armed                                          and equipped  and in order to see that this be not neglected  it      will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of      a year          Alexander Hamilton  Federalist Paper 29  speaking of standing      armies        if circumstances should at any time oblige the      government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be      formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large      body of citizens  little  if at all  inferior to them in                            discipline and the use of arms  who stand ready to defend their                                                                           own rights and those of their fellow-citizens                                                         But  surely  Hamilton and Madison didn t mean the PEOPLE when they  said  people   right   That s why the Amendment refers to  the Right  of the Militia        -       Your average     17-45 year old male does not fall into the definition     You re right  the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males  and  probably females under current interpretation         Therefore most    members of The Militia  the one the every gun advocate refers to  are    not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directly    The Amendment does nor refer to  well organized   it says  well  regulated    I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check  how  well regulated  I am        mentioned in the amendment       If this amendment wanted to allow every member of The Militia to keep    and bear arms  why did it specificly mention a  well organized militia      in the SAME SENTENCE as the right to keep and bear arms     Correct   That s why the Right is reserved to the People   And that  was to insure the People could form a  well regulated Militia   not a   well organized militia        It could be    argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last     part   If so  why was it include in the same atomic unit of written    What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument   Any moron can set  h bar   C   1         instead of a separate sentence     Oh  I see what your question is  Why don t you read the federalist  Papers           James Madison  Federalist Paper 41  regarding the  General      Welfare  clause    Nothing is more natural nor common than first      to use a general phrase  and then to explain and qualify it by a      recital of particulars      But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd   He  only wrote it       The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with     the security of a free state   The Federalist Paper s mention of a    well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects    the security of a free state   All these examples are actions of a    very organized force  not some John Q  Public with a gun     That s obviously because you ve never actually  read  the Federalist  Papers        All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me is that the people s    right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed   That is     people have the right to join a well organized militia   This well    organized militia will  of course  provide training in how to use arms    and in basic military tactics   These training members of the militia    can keep and bear the arms     Can t read  huh   Show me where the document says  well organized  militia         Lastly  reading through the Federalist Paper s on well organized     militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias     One reason stated is the protection from a standing army   These days    the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every     17-45 year old male and female not in the armied forces     That is  exactly  why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own  any   weapon currently in use in the armed forces       Another    reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need    for a standing army   Well  the US Armied Forces have been a standing    army for more than half the history of the US     But the major reason is to protect against that very same army       It seems to me the whole reason for the Second Amendment  to give    the people protection from the US government by guaranteeing that the    people can over through the government if necessary  is a little bit    of an anachronism is this day and age   Maybe its time to re-think    how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately         Abraham Lincoln  First Inaugural Address  March 4  1861   This      country  with its institutions  belongs to the people who inhabit      it   Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government       they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it  or      their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it          Rep  Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts  spoken during floor debate      over the Second Amendment  I Annals of Congress at 750  17 August      1789   What  Sir  is the use of a militia   It is to prevent the      establishment of a standing army  the bane of liberty           Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of      the people  they always attempt to destroy the militia  in order      to raise an army upon their ruins      So now we know

concluded that it did  hence the          embarassing  in his title      - Report of the Subcomittee on the Consititution  United States Sendate      97th Congress  Second Session February 1982     -

of the organized militia  and all female officers of     the national guard are part of the unorganized militia   Feel free to cite any scholarly and historical references you have to support your position   I could go on a greater length with my personal proof by assertion  however  such a technique would carry no more or less weight that your dubious proofs by assertion   </snippet>

House today in              conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip              encryption technology                                    FACT SHEET                          PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT        The President has approved a directive on  Public Encryption    Management    The directive provides for the following         Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption    are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology     Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of    communications and data by preventing unauthorized access     Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to    rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications     These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the    infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the    information age         Despite its benefits  new communications technology can also    frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance   Sophisticated    encryption can have this effect in the United States   When    exported abroad  it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence    activities critical to our national interests   In the past  it has    been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct    electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law    enforcement and national security interests  while at the same time    protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens   As    encryption technology improves  doing so will require new     innovative approaches         In the area of communications encryption  the U  S  Government has    developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through    encryption that is substantially more robust than the current    government standard  but also permits escrowing of the keys needed    to unlock the encryption   The system for the escrowing of keys    will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information    only with appropriate legal authorization         To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect    and decrypt  under legal authority  electronically transmitted    information  I hereby direct the following action to be taken         INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS        The Attorney General of the United States  or her representative     shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which    incorporates encryption to install the U S  government-developed    key-escrow microcircuits in their products   The fact of law    enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from    the American public   All appropriate steps shall be taken to    ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow    microcircuit are made widely available to U S  communications    hardware manufacturers  consistent with the need to ensure the    security of the key-escrow system   In making this decision  I do    not intend to prevent the private sector from developing  or the    government from approving  other microcircuits or algorithms that    are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-    escrow system         KEY-ESCROW        The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate    entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits    installed in communications equipment   In each case  the key    holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent    unauthorized release of the keys   The keys shall be released only    to government agencies that have established their authority to    acquire the content of those communications that have been    encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits   The Attorney    General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which    an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such    communications         PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES        The Secretary of Commerce  in consultation with other appropriate    U S  agencies  shall initiate a process to write standards to    facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted    with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems    that process sensitive but unclassified information   I expect this    process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of    a final standard within six months of this directive         The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government s ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications   Further  the Attorney General    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase        ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </snippet>

but the latter statement is not something to base policy decisions on     Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children  ages 14 and under   According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence  formerly the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change  don t you think   who include murder and suicide by firearms in the  leading causes of unintentional death  figures but  don t  include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death   Can t you see past the bullshit      I don t understand how the ratio to other accidental  deaths is important   So guns don t kill as many children as car accidents   What is the difference in severity between 1 000 deaths and 10 000 deaths   I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a  justification for gun control   Who needs to be convinced that accidental  gun deaths of children is a serious problem   I assumed that any humane  person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents  gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends   Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a  stastically serious problem   and even if you don t use these deaths as a justification for gun control  these groups do   I m sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern  but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures  I think the conclusion was a reasonable one  The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be  they are  not  a serious problem statistically speaking     Please explain why you think  symbolic offerings  do good       My point was  gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police  departments MIGHT  I stress might  do a LITTLE  I stress little  good by  giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond  to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way   Overall  I thought that I  had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were  useful   Sorry if it wasn t clear to me   I thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings   I have to disagree on all these counts  I can t understand how a buying guns from people who aren t intending to misuse them  obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren t going to turn them in  could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to  interpersonal violence      I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these  statistics  - I   suspect you ll find if you look carefully that 135 000 is the number of   students  estimated  to have carried  a weapon   not necessarily a gun    to school at least once in the past year  and not the number of students   who carry a gun to school daily       Well Joe  I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence  What  the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL METHODS per year   Who do you think I should believe   The people who call everyone up to age 24  children  when they re screaming about the  carnage of our nation s children  being caused by handguns    or the Centers for Disease Control   Ah  yes  the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People 2000 document is to  enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire  minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children    The agency that funded the  study  of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban had saved X lives  yes  they actually gave us a number  on the basis of a look at the  number  of shootings rather than the  rate  of shootings  It wasn t their fault that the population of DC dropped in their  post law  period         If YOU look carefully you will see  that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths   The CPHV reports that 135 000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that  400 000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year   The CDC estimates  that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once  in 1990   Okay  I ll concede I no longer have the numbers I once read on these   I ll retract my dispute of your numbers   However  I would be greatly interested in seeing how CPHV and CDC came up with these numbers      The CDC also says that 1 2 million elementary-aged  latch-key  children  kids who come home from school to an empty house   have access  to guns in their home   What s this got to do with anything   Hell  when  I  was in elementary school I came home to an empty house with guns in it   Why is this a problem   I didn t touch the guns - I had been taught not to   I had also been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage  the fuse box  the car  the knives  the oven  and the tools   The problem is not the guns  it s the parents        California schools reported a 200  increase in  student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990  and a 40  increase between  1988 and 1990   Florida reported a 61  percent increase in gun incidents in  schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88   These are the  statistics    And what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns  NOTHING   No criminal prosecution  no expulsion  in most cases not even suspension   They take the gun  slap the kids on the wrist  say  ain t it awful   and go on as if everything s back to normal   What s wrong with this picture     Okay  maybe I worded it wrong   DAD   I meant that to put children in a  situation  fortified compound  where harm could come to them is not the  act of a Messiah in my opinion   I m not saying that Koresh had control over  these children directly  but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is  would not let innocent children die   I don t think Koresh was the Messiah  either    but isn t it obvious that if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him  then he believed the children were much safer inside the compound   I didn t say he was sane    just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what he thought was going on   He thought he had them in the one place where harm  wouldn t  come to them    If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such  why  did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them  burn alive   Let s see  you  try to find the exits  unbarricade them  and flee a fire when you ve been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected to six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault     -joe </snippet>

Covey   covey  andrew cmu edu  Subject  Gun Stats   Mortal Risks Date  Mon  15 Feb 1993 18 35 05 -0500  EST    Folks   Hail from the nether world   On February 4th  the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled  Armed Force    I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that  A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect    I sent the following to the WSJ   -----  Gun Stats   Mortal Risks  Preston K  Covey    Erik Larson s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley   Armed Force   2 4 93  WSJ  cites the world s most notorious  statistic  regarding guns in the home    A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County  Washington  found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner  spouse  a friend or child than to kill an intruder    The  43 times  stat is everywhere these days   it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth  it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to  93    Given the shock value of the finding  the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine  NEJM  study is remarkably understated    The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned       Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home    But what we need to know is this   What exactly are the risks and benefits   The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks   Further  as with motor vehicles  we want to know   What control do we have over the risks and benefits   And  as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents   How can we minimize the risks   Like raw highway death tolls  the NEJM stat is not very helpful here     The NEJM finding purports to inform us  but it is framed to warn us off   It is widely promulgated in the media as a  scare stat   a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify   The frightful statistic screams for itself   The risks far outweigh the benefits  yes    What fool would run these risks    If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you  a loved one  a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination   should you not take the bus      Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies    Surely  we can do better where lives are at stake    Let s take a closer look at this risky business    The  43 times  stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense  the divisor  into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home  the dividend    The divisor of this risk equation is 9  in the study s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense   The dividend is 387   in the study there were 12 accidental deaths  42 criminal homicides  and 333 suicides   387 divided by 9 yields 43   There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983   so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted    The NEJM s notorious  43 times  statistic is seriously misleading on six counts    1   The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media   the  or acquaintances  of the study  who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members  is equated to  friends    The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members  dear friends  and innocent children   Deaths may all be equally tragic  but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk   These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors   This is criminological hogwash    2    The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent  criminal  or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk  for example  people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing  gang banging and wife beating  -- where the risk is very low indeed   In actuality  negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents  and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse  people who are identifiably and certifiably at  high risk  for misadventure   To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths  by tautology  neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles  but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk     3   One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect  and this obscures -- indeed  disregards -- the role of personal responsibility   The typical quotation of this study  unlike Larson s  attributes fatal agency to the gun    A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill            The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence  a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic  uses this particular formulation    We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it s people or guns that accomplish the killing   again  by tautology  gun  deaths would not occur without the guns   The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway  without the guns   In any case  people are the death-dealing agents  the guns are their lethal instruments   The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice   Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents  human choice mediates homicide and suicide  by gun or otherwise    The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM s high-risk pool   The gun does not create this risk by itself   People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes   For example  graduates of Paxton Quigley s personal protection course do not run the touted  43 times  risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers   Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice  just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic  criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death   This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities   Fortunately  nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter    4   Suicide accounts for 84  of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study   As against the total deaths by gun in King County  including those outside the home  in-house suicides are 44  of the total death toll  which is closer to the roughly 50  proportion found by other studies   Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents   The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns   It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed   It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides   This is widely assumed or alleged  but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise  that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases    See   Bruce L  Danto et al   The Human Side of Homicide   Columbia University Press  1982   Charles Rich et al     Guns and Suicide    American Journal of Psychiatry   March 1990    If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study s risk equation  the  43 times  stat would deflate to  six    The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes  durability  or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter   Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue    5   Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide   Most measures  like the NEJM homicide rate  are based on the immediate disposition of cases   But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense   In the literature on battered women  immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide  Time s January 18  1993  cover story on women  Fighting Back  reported one study s finding that 40  of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out   Time s July 17  1989  cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51  of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims  but only 3  of the homicides were reported as self-defense   In a May 14  1990  update  Time  reported that 12  of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense  In Time s sample  the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four   The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic     6   While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated  the divisor is unconscionably misleading   The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed   not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at    The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes   What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings    Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled  apprehended  or deterred   Should we not celebrate  let alone count   those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses   The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this   Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense  notably by criminologist Gary Kleck  Point Blank  Guns and Violence in America   Aldine de Gruyter  1992    Kleck s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies   the rate is high  about one million a year  and the risk is good  gun defenders fare better than anyone  either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist    Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30 000 annual gun deaths  from self-defense  homicides  suicides  and accidents  yields 33   Thus  we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat     A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody       Of course  Kleck s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation  what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control   We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck s high estimation of defensive firearm use  as I have questioned the NEJM statistic   Clearly  the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics    One thing troubles me still   we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media   but we hardly ever find Kleck s good work mentioned   even critically   --  Larry Cipriani -- l v cipriani att com </snippet>

 And I suppose the FBI also prevented them from coming out with their         hands up while national tv cameras watch                Watch from where   Two miles away   Far enough away that whatever       really happenned must be explained through the vengeful filter of       a humiliated agency that said  quote    Enough is enough              Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people       come out with their hands up several weeks ago           It didn t happen       And who is responsible for it not happening    Certainly not the children   Koresh was calling the shots   He was    talking with his lawyer and the FBI   Since others were released safely     there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound      The FBI and Koresh were calling the shots   And there were very sane reasons   for keeping the children  if they let them go  the parents would NEVER see them   again   That is not an easy choice  in spite of you cold attitude about it          scenario that is simplest and most plausible   I do not generally         believe in conspiracy theories that involve complicated and unlikely         scenarios               The FBI sent letters to Martin Luther King s wife insinuating       that MLK was having an affair   Again  please tell us exactly       how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government             More than someone who would not release children from the compound           Obviously   You are an authority worshiper       Not at all   Are you a Koresh worshiper   I am a constitution worshiper   You quite obviously eat anything the   authorities feed you  without doubt  which makes you no different that a Koresh   worshiper          I e   more than David Koresh Vernon Howell  Jesus Christ        I saw lengthy excerpts from an Australian documentary made in       1992 that clearly showed that this was a cult         Give me a camera  and time with you  and I can present excerpts that show   you      to be a cult leader   Guarenteed        Thanks for my laugh of the day   Definitely a very silly supposition     If you do not believe this  you are truly naive   It is not only possible  it   is easy   I worked in the broadcast profession  at a network station  in the   late 70s  I know what I m saying here   Embarrasing footage is easy to get  add   a little sinister music  and the right voice-over  and I ll have you mother   agreeing to commit you      You should at least view the whole      documentary before you claim it as a source       I would if I could   The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also    had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically    confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the    compound in 1992     The news shows were looking for excerpts which backed their position   Do you   think they would show excerpts which disproved their points        I am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair   I think they       bungled it badly from the start   But I don t think they are       responsible for the fire  which started in two different places         Two places  eh   You saw this   Or did the wonderful FBI tell you this       I saw one place       I believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site    A fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two    story window shown on the tv coverage     The reports of multi-starts came solely from the FBI   Anyone observing the   fire from the available video would be hard pressed to see more than one point   of fire   Which spread across the compound as a uniform rate          The BATF is by no means devoid of fault in the handling of this affair         But to suggest that they may have intentionally started the fire is         ludicrous               I suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to       risk small arms fire to get some good footage   These people       were told to get the hell out of camera range   Why         Couldn t answer this one  eh   This is the most important question of all    it      is the root cause of all the other suspicion       I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press    in Grenada and how that set the precedent  but decided it wasn t worthy    of discussion   If the news reporter got shot  you can bet his family    would sue the government for letting him into the danger area   No reported has ever sued the government for such a situation   They know the   dangers   Remember  the BATF invited the initial coverage  And how about a   simple  remote-controlled  camera or two   There were ways to provide media   access   The FBI obviously just didn t want any        The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn t flee    a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took    to burn down   Or why didn t they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was    first introduced   I can find no rational explanation for their behavior     I can find several   Tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the   barricades   Flames blocking exits to the saferooms  Perhaps the gun shots were   from the FBI  keeping them pinned in   Who knows     --      Jim -- jmd handheld com

mailing list  Karl Kleinpaste  has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information   This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates  Wright  Tonso  Levinson  Supreme Court Decisions  the RIA vs US decision  copies of legislation  and so on   It s not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here   So  in the future if you re looking for something check there first and then ask here   Instructions   Short version for techies   The site is godiva nectar cs cmu edu   Place contributions into the directory  usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba   The ftp commands get  put  mget  or mput should work   Give the command  type binary  to be sure files are transferred correctly   Your files will be moved to the rkba directory   To get a file use the commands get or mget   I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived   Long version for non-techies   In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet   To connect to the archive site run the command    ftp godiva nectar cs cmu edu  If that doesn t work you cannot use this archive   If the ftp command is successful you ll get this prompt asking you for a login   Name  godiva nectar cs cmu edu lvc    Instead of lvc your initials will appear   Answer this prompt with    ftp  Next you ll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address    Guest login ok  send e-mail address as password   I would enter    l v cipriani att com  You ll enter your own e-mail address   You ll get these lines or similar as output    Remote system is UNIX   Using binary mode to transfer files   Next  the command prompt is printed    ftp    If you do not get the line  Using binary mode to transfer files   Run the command    type binary  Now you re logged in to the archive machine   There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are    usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba and   usr0 anon pub firearms politics incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory  those are discussed below   When you login to the system your directory is  usr0 anon   To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command    cd  usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba or  cd pub firearms politics rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command    cd  usr0 anon pub firearms politics incoming or  cd pub firearms politics incoming  Once you do this you ll get another ftp  prompt asking you to enter another command   To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command    ls -l  This will produce something like   total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932

Aug  4  1992 aclu     and so on      Each line corresponds to one file   Reading right to left  the fields are the file name  the last modification date of the file  the size of the file in bytes  and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with   To get a file run the command  get  followed by the name of the file you want  for example    get INDEX or  get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this    Transfer complete   19580 bytes received in 5 seconds  4 Kbytes s   You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive  You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files   If the file you want is in a subdirectory  for example  congress 103rd HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it    cd congress 103rd  get HR1025  Once you re finished you can log off with the command    quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different   First of all you should find out if the file already exists  so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn t repeat an entry   The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory   For example   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File  whitemanslaw  White Man s Law by William R  Tonso  from the December 1985 Reason magazine ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Once you ve determined you won t be duplicating an entry  login and change to the incoming directory command  see above    Once you are in the incoming directory use the command    put file name  In this case    put whitemanslaw  Again there ll be a  Transfer complete  so many bytes transfered in so many seconds  message   Now your file is on the archive machine   Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file  names    Be sure there isn t a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write   If you use the same name you ll overwrite the previous file  or you ll get an error message    Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory   Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file   If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I ll take care of the rest   If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed  so be sure to let me know first   If you have any questions feel free to ask me  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --  Larry Cipriani -- l v cipriani att com      --  Michael Phelps

edu  Donald R  Newcomb  writes   First  I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and  erudite an individual as Mr  Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic   Frankly  most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of  the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the  writings of the era  This  is most refreshing     Second  I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days   My brigade s quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend  to several matters pertaining to the State Militia     Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-  nism that is out of place in the 20th century  I m not sure the Swiss  would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia  both  organized and unorganized  fits into the defense plans of my State   Mississippi  Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar  to one southern state  For instance  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  has a well organized Militia which  members report  maintains stocks  of both riot guns and machine guns  The laws of other States will vary  but are probably similar   It appears it is time that this article  originally posted by Larry Cipriani last year  and which I saved  gets posted again   It offers as good an analysis of the meaning of the Second Amendment  especially regarding the militia clause  as I have seen   I have not seen any rebuttles with similar bone fides     Enjoy    Flames to  dev null   --------- Begin Enclosed Article -----------     THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT           by J  Neil Schulman  If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang  you d ring up Carl Sagan  right    And if you wanted to know about desert warfare  the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf  no question about it   But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage  to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution    That was the question I asked A C  Brocki  editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system   Mr  Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud  a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of  American Usage and Style  The Consensus    A little research lent support to Brocki s opinion of Professor Copperud s expertise   Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC   Since 1952  Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for  Editor and Publisher   a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field   He s on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary  and Merriam Webster s Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert   Copperud s fifth book on usage   American Usage and Style  The Consensus   has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981  and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher s Humanities Award   That sounds like an expert to me   After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested  I sent the following letter    I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage  to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution  and extract the intent from the text    The text of the Second Amendment is   A well-regulated Militia  being necessary for the security of a free State  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall not be infringed     The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence   A well-regulated Militia  being necessary to the security of a free State   is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause  with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence   the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall not be infringed     I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy  but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent   Further  since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment  I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation  and even be willing to testify under oath to support  if necessary    My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment  then concluded    I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter   I am doing so because  as a citizen  I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment  While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results  I ask that you do this because of that importance    After several more letters and phone calls  in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis  but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment  gun control  or any other political subject  Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis  into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity     Copperud    The words  A well-regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state   contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26  1991  constitutes a present participle  rather than a clause   It is used as an adjective  modifying  militia   which is followed by the main clause of the sentence  subject  the right   verb  shall     The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia    In reply to your numbered questions    Schulman     1  Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to  a well-regulated militia      Copperud     1  The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms  nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people  it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people     Schulman     2  Is  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  granted by the words of the Second Amendment  or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms  and merely state that such right  shall not be infringed      Copperud     2  The right is not granted by the amendment  its existence is assumed   The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia     Schulman     3  Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia  is  in fact necessary to the security of a free State  and if that condition is not existing  is the statement  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall not be infringed  null and void     Copperud     3  No such condition is expressed or implied   The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia   No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state   The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence     Schulman     4  Does the clause  A well-regulated Militia  being necessary to the security of a free State   grant a right to the government to place conditions on the  right of the people to keep and bear arms   or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence     Copperud     4  The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional  as previously stated   It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia     Schulman     5  Which of the following does the phrase  well-regulated militia  mean   well-equipped    well-organized    well-drilled    well-educated   or  subject to regulations of a superior authority      Copperud     5  The phrase means  subject to regulations of a superior authority   this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military     Schulman     6   If at all possible  I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words  or usage  since that sentence was written 200 years ago  but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors  unless those issues can be clearly separated     Copperud    To the best of my knowledge  there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment   If it were written today  it might be put   Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state  the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged     Schulman    As a  scientific control  on this analysis  I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence    A well-schooled electorate  being necessary to the security of a free State  the right of the people to keep and read Books  shall not be infringed     My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be     1  Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other  identical to the Second Amendment s sentence   and    2  Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict  the right of the people to keep and read Books   only  to  a well-educated electorate  -- for example  registered voters with a high-school diploma     Copperud     1  Your  scientific control  sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure     2  There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation    Professor Copperud had only one additional comment  which he placed in his cover letter   With well-known human curiosity  I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used  but was unable to reach any conclusion    So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along  the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people s right to keep and bear arms  forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right   As I write this  the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed  apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power   And here in the United States  elected lawmakers  judges  and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore  marginalize  or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely  American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms  owning arms of forbidden sorts  or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms  guaranteed by the Constitution   And even the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU   staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights  stands by and does nothing   it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right   no one else will   No one else can   Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights  and continue regarding them as representing us if they do   Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn t mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak    Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice  as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can  and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives  our fortuned  and our sacred honor     C  1991 by The New Gun

edu  writes          Gun buyback programs will hopefully      have an impact on accidental shootings  especially youths   domestic      disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger  and      maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street-level      crime           What gives you the idea that gun  buyback  programs will have an impact on     any of these things   Evidence  please            Please don t misinterret  what I was saying Joe   I was making the point  tha    there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if    there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types    of common incidents         If you re a  Research Associate  in  Urban Child Research   then perhaps     you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the     rate of accidental death from other single causes   Follow that perhaps     with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti-gunners     spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun-related death     among children in the U S  is a serious problem           Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children    ages 14 and under   I don t understand how the ratio to other accidental    deaths is important   So guns don t kill as many children as car accidents     What is the difference in severity between 1 000 deaths and 10 000 deaths     I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a    justification for gun control   Who needs to be convinced that accidental    gun deaths of children is a serious problem   I assumed that any humane    person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents    gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends        Any death is serious   Wanna discuss match control   Firearms related  unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under are the fault of one or  more negligent persons  not the gun       Did I say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent   NO   I hate to repeat myself Jim  but like I told Joe  I was not attempting in any way to justify gun control   You re right  any death is serious  THAT was my point to Joe who said that  anti-gunners  try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem   I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a problem  No  I don t want to discuss match control   I don t equate a book of matches to a loaded 9 millimeter either   Don t confuse the issue   And please don t say that tired old NRA line  Guns don t kill people  people kill people   Sure  people can kill people without guns   But easy access to guns makes it a lot more convenient    Guns don t kill people  People with easy access to guns kill people          More than anything  gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the      community   In that sense  I think they might do a little good           Please explain why you think  symbolic offerings  do good           My point was  gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police    departments MIGHT  I stress might  do a LITTLE  I stress little  good by    giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond    to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way   Overall  I thought that I    had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were    useful        Providing false hope  then  is the intent        Jim  I m just saying how it is   I m not saying if that is a good thing or not  From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs  I get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community   When I ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program  they say  well no      So  in answer to your question  no  false hope is not the intent   I think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not   Look  if you can t measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test evaluation  what is the point   It must be symbolic in nature   The police are essentially saying  look  if you have a gun lying around and you don t want it  we ll give you  50 for it   because we care about the community   If you  I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous            I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or      brought to school by youths on a daily basis  about 135 000 youths  are      obtained easily and quickly  through a personal friend  or more often       borrowed  from a parent without their knowledge           I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these  statistics  - I     suspect you ll find if you look carefully that 135 000 is the number of     students  estimated  to have carried  a weapon   not necessarily a gun      to school at least once in the past year  and not the number of students     who carry a gun to school daily           Well Joe  I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence    or the Centers for Disease Control   If YOU look carefully you will see    that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths     The CPHV reports that 135 000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that    400 000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year   The CDC estimates    that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once    in 1990   The CDC also says that 1 2 million elementary-aged  latch-key    children  kids who come home from school to an empty house   have access    to guns in their home   California schools reported a 200  increase in    student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990  and a 40  increase between    1988 and 1990   Florida reported a 61  percent increase in gun incidents in    schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88   These are the  statistics         200  increase in California schools  eh   Gun control is working fine  there         I didn t anything about gun control  what are you talking about         thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah  Got news      for you folks  if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours      presently  he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they      were in danger             Holding kids    Time for a reality check  son   These kids were the     children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were     outside waiting to kill them   Would you send  your  children out the door     if you believed as they did           Okay  maybe I worded it wrong   DAD   I meant that to put children in a    situation  fortified compound  where harm could come to them is not the    act of a Messiah in my opinion   I m not saying that Koresh had control over    these children directly  but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is    would not let innocent children die     If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such  why    did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them    burn alive   Thanks for the reality check Joe  its been real      So your religion is different   Does that make it his wrong   Even assuming  Koresh actually made that decision  and the verdict is still out on that      Jim  listen to me  I said I M NOT RELIGIOUS WHATSOEVER  do you understand    Religion has nothing to do with this   I could care less what religion they were okay   To put children in that situation is wrong  pure and simple   Difference is good Jim  I am the most progressive and diverse person in the world   But  if different is allowing kids to be exposed to tanks and tear-gas  then yes Jim  DIFFERENT IS WRONG    </snippet>

		<snippet>From  crphilli hound dazixca ingr com  Ron Phillips  Subject  Waco Questions   Folks   It s time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local TV  radio and newprint media   Ideally  these questions could be asked at any investigation into the BATF s and FBI s participation at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and  hopefully  wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the BATF and FBI   My list is up to 13 that are really nagging  at my gut   The list will probably grow    1    What were the contents of the original warrant  now sealed  that      the BATF obtained   2    It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and or ammunition      could not be flushed down the toilet   Therefore  a  no-knock       raid could be ruled out   Prior to the initial assault on the       complex  did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness  without       a contingent of assault and news media personnel  attempt to knock       on the door of the Branch Davidian s complex and serve the warrant       in a manner prescribed by law   3    On the day of the initial assault on the complex  BATF agents      were aware that several small children were inside the buildings       In the ensueing gun battle  BATF agents fired into a building      known to contain children  killing at least one two-year old child       Knowing children were present  why didn t the BATF have an      alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to      the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening      fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building    4    The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that      David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over       200 000 in firearms and ammunition   Did David Koresh and the      members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms      License  were they actively participating in the legal business      of selling buying firearms and ammunition  and were any of the      weapons they had illegally possessed   Does this paper evidence      consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally      dispossessed weapons   5    After the original assault on the compound tragically failed       a BATF spokeswoman stated  We were outgunned     Yet  TV newscasts      of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents      armed with MP-5 and AR-15 M16 rifles   Although unclear on the      video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent s      bodies  they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles   What type s       of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the       scene of the original assault on the complex   6    Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the      complex involuntarily  why did the FBI treat it as a  hostage       situation    7    Along the same lines  why did the FBI use  psychological warfare       techniques  including sensory overload  sleep deprivation  and      other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any       normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the       complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind   8    Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex      were accompanied by their mothers   Since it is reasonable      to expect these mothers would have their children taken away      from them if they came out  why did the FBI expect the mothers      to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities   9    Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch      Davidians setting fire to the complex   Branch Davidian members      who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an       armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a       lantern which was setting on a table   Video tape of the incident       does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the       fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location         Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle       penetrated   10   FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and      the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide   Yet       bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas      within the building complex   This seems to be counter to any      known mass suicides through history   What evidence does the FBI      have that a mass suicide pact existed   11   FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on      the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian s ammunition      and or powder cache exploding   Yet  the fireball seems to be      more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas      or other highly volatile fuel source explodes   Was any evidence       found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition       and or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball   If so       and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were       engaged in the legal business of selling buying firearms  was the      amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect      for someone engaged in such a legal business   12   It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical      news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to      crush a reporter s car which had been left at the compound   Is       there any factual basis to this rumor and  if so  what charges will       be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act   13   FBI Director Sessions states that  during the final assault on the      complex   over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles    On the video      tape of the incident  you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles      engines   Yet  there is no sound of the sharp reports that one      would expect to hear if shots were fired   Also  there are no       indications of smoke and or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows       buildings or other structures in the video   Surely  these should be       evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles         Finally  the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter        sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be       apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles   Do       any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas       into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by       shots from high-power rifles   14   CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent   The United      States has signed international treaties which prevent the use      of CS gas in warfare   If the United States could not morally use      CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops  why is it morally      acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land   15   On April 21  FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered      in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had      been murdered or had committed suicide   On April 22  the county      coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet      wounds to the head   Were any of the victims bodies found within      the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head  --                                                                   Ron Phillips               crphilli hound dazixca ingr com

		<snippet>From  porges beretta camb inmet com  Don Porges  Subject  Re  JFFO has gone a bit too far   Having read the posted long article by JPFO  I have some observations   1   This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a  verbatim  translation  of a Nazi law   What it says is that in another place -- the book they re talking about -- they compare the two things section by section   The implication is that the similarities are devastating  In the next sentence  they talk about how in that book they reproduce  the German text of the Nazi law  together with its translation   Not  surprisingly  a reader could easily conflate these two things into a  single idea   that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law  and sure enough  that s what the whole thing has mutated into   urban-folklore style   2   The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a  copy of the Nazi law  either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution  team or later   This fact is considered highly incriminating  but I don t  understand why   The author repeats several times that he is simply unable  to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text  and  yet in a paragraph towards the end  he explains it perfectly    If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg  it likely was part of a collection of documents  for example  issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt  the German law registry     Bingo   Exactly     Dodd had a  book   with a series of Nazi laws in it  including the one under discussion   All of the stuff about  Why would a U S  congressman have a copy of a Nazi law   melts away  by the author s admission   He then continues    But if he acquired the original German text of the  Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg  he must have done so  for a very specific reason      But there s absolutely no reason to  think that this is the case   In fact  as a  senior member of the U S   team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals   it seems to me that he would have  had  to have a copy   All arguments about whether  the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest  as it obviously is  certainly according to the author here   or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it  can be put aside as red  herrings   3   Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text  the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he  asked to have it translated   The problem is  in the context of the charge  levelled at Dodd  these two things work  against  each other   People ask  to have things translated when they  don t know what they mean    If Dodd  took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing  it into American law  surely by 1968 he would have know what it  meant    wouldn t he      Anyway  this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly   Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose   Is the idea that the gun controllers  despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties  needed a crib sheet   Didn t they have any idea how to do it on their own      Once again  the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question   Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the  Nazi law    In fact  since the law and its translation  were  entered into the Congressional Record  under the heading of documents  concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation   Dodd s motivation isn t a  mystery   he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR   4   Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added  by  the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law    Registration of guns  for instance  was begun in 1928  and thus NOT a  Nazi-inspired  idea   The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the  1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort  and the identification  of certain weapons as sporting weapons   The JPFO then goes on to list  other parts of the Nazi law  forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews  of course  there are no such provisions in the American GCA   Nevertheless  in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters  immediately after the  discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law  the JPFO article continues    Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA 68     -- so  as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law  --       -- Don Porges      porges inmet camb inmet com        uunet inmet porges </snippet>

stratus com  C  D  Tavares  writes        Obnly something like 12  of guns used in crime in the US are purchased     from legitimate dealers  and not necessarily by the person who used them    in the crime    So we already HAVE that much  gun control        I ve seen this mentioned a number of times  I m curious  what is the   source for this statistic    The number bounces between 2  and 18   depending on the study quoted and the type of gun being studied   Some cites   ---------------------------------------  A recent BATF study  titled  Protecting America  Yes   surveyed 471 career  criminals and found that only 7  of guns used in violent crimes were purchased from retail dealers   ---------------------------------------  National Institute of Justice Research in Brief  November 1986                          The Armed Criminal in America                               by James D  Wright   1  Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct     sources of handguns for adult felony offenders   Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a licensed firearms dealer   The remainder -- five out of six -- obtained them via informal  off-the-record transactions involving friends and associates  family members  and various black market outlets   The means of acquisition from these informal sources included cash purchase  swaps and trades  borrowing and renting  and often theft   The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply   ---------------------------------------  INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No  4- 91 Independence Institute 14142 Denver West Parkway  101 Golden  CO 80401   303  279-6536                WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY                              By David B  Kopel       The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville  The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous criminals  51   In short  waiting periods have no statistically noticeable impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers   51  Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms  Assistant Director of Criminal Enforcement  Memorandum to Director  July 10  1975  Greenville survey  of 20 047 names submitted to FBI for record checks  68 had felony convictions  of those  41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who committed crimes in the distant past  twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted   of the 1 3  of buyers selected for prosecution   9  had non-violent felony convictions  and  4  had violent convictions   Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms  Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement  memorandum to Director  May 8  1975  of 374 records checked  39 were purchasers with felony records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or non-violent nature of felony  six purchasers were prosecuted    ---------------------------------------

             By Eric Morgan and David Kopel       Testimony before Congress revealed that most  assault weapons  in the hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels  97   The testimony is consistent with the National Institute of Justice s research findings based on studies of felons in state prisons  The NU study  authored by sociologists James D  Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store   The figures included purchases by legal surrogates  rather than directly by the criminal   Wright and Rossi  who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control  concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases  and probably not even full scale gun prohibition  would reduce criminal use of guns  Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime directly target the black market in criminal guns  and leave the legitimate retail market alone  98    Not surprisingly  Wright believes that the consequences of current  assault weapon  legislation on street violence are likely to be ineffective  99    He warns that gun controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new business  100   6     See   e g   The Anti-drug  Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989  S  Rep  No  160

		<snippet>From  loki acca nmsu edu  Entropic Destroyer  Subject  Letter in Colorado Daily   The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal s article on Paxton Quigley  including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal tacked onto the end   After recieving much assistance from various T P G  type folks  I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph  and surprise  surprise  surprise  they published it   The text follows  The Colorado Daily  btw  is the University of Colorado  Boulder  student  I think  newspaper    not exactly a big coup  but every little bit  i guess      The title was the only thing they changed added    Gun Stats   The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal  primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley  author of  Armed and Female    The article  in turn  cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine   The article states   A study    found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner  spouse  a friend  or child than to kill an intruder    This is an often-quoted statistic  and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons  outlined below   The study gives the impression that  if you own a  gun  the likelihood that you will successfully use it to  defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you   The study  however  fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun  to thwart a crime  without actually killing the perpe- trator   The study actually refers to  acquaintances  rather than  friend    This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork  every month  the second your grandmother cashes her social security check   Possibly an acquaintance  but hardly a friend   The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense   Especially considering the small sample  size  396   taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43 1 ratio quoted   Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic  a gun is 33 times more likely to be  used  successfully  by a private citizen against an  aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all   Further  per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a  gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means  or who offer no resistance at all  Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies  also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide  535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody  and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide   It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can  be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics   One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them   D F  Taylor CU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry   -- Spooksmoke  Revolution  Assasination  Thorium  Cobalt-60  Clintin  CIA  NSA  SHC   DoD  202   loki acca nmsu edu   liberty or death   taylordf ucsu colorado edu                   Send me something even YOU can t read    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version  2 2  mQCNAitfksQAAAEEAKceEjWI9f5KMJyKP0LOgC5dGHRpbMY2xhOo8kpEHMDyuf8a 1BfDQSj53kosTz6HRoshSDzLVuL1 40vPjmMNtFR vyZ4jvd3rL4iuq2umMmex3M itf3uLt8Xn v QAbsvhcFSHVJVK4Lf6wosuCMO03m2TiX31AI7VB0Uzo4yXjAAUX tCREYW5pZWwgRiBUYXlsb3IgPExva2lAYWNjYS5ubXN1LmVkdT4   S5ib -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- </snippet>

		<snippet>From  dhartung chinet chi il us  Dan Hartung  Subject  Re  The Truth about Waco   jgd dixie com  John De Armond  writes   Nothing could at this point   What WOULD have gone a long way toward   convincing me would have been media video  particularly from diverse  sources   IMHO  if the government didn t have anything to hide  they  would have allowed cameras near the compound from the beginning   I agree  I saw no reason they could not have had  close in  pool cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever    Points made by Dick DeGueran  Koresh s lawyer     The tanks were NOT pumping CS gas but were ejecting exploding    canisters from the tank booms that penetrated multiple walls   before exploding   Okay  their word against the FBI s at this point   See ya in court      The tanks were collapsing interior walls and ceilings putting people   at great risk   Dear  dear  They could have COME OUT      The construction of the coupound used almost all used materials that   were very dry and bails of hay were stacked against the walls as    shields against the government s bullets   Okay  they were living in a fire hazard  That they built      Said that previous to the invasion there were no military drills   and that the supplies they had on hand were for survival   No crime  irrelevant either way      Their gas masks worked so well that many members were having bible   study and some were sleeping when the fire was set   Ah yes  that is exactly what I would do   Hold Bible study  Take a nap  Always a wise course of action when you re being gassed      There was no group instruction of any kind from Koresh or his    aids after the tank invasion  referring to any kind of suicide   pact or counter-assault efforts    I don t believe there was a  suicide pact    I believe that Koresh wanted a fiery conflagration     which he may not have told his followers  In fact  this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors  stories      Everyone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape   the falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was set    Yes  that s right   And once the whole compound was demolished  where did they expect to go      Women and children who has sought shelter on the second floor from   the tanks were trapped by doors jammed by the tanks ramming the    building and distorting the frames   The building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS   That s almost as bad as running into a fire      Hallways ran the length of the buildings that acted as conduits for   the fire and trapped almost everyone in place   His experts have told   him that this horizonal chimney effect is what made the fire appear   to have started at several places at once   Hm  an interesting notion   We ll see      Koresh was not seen the last hour before the fire and was assumed to   be in his 4th floor room with some of his children   More Bible study  no doubt   Hey  it s a  priority       The texas medical examiner has stated flatly that none of the bodies   recovered so far had bullet wounds  directly contradicting the FBI s   lies   Actually  on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and he could not flatly contradict the federal agents  claims   We ll know more later   In any event  it s irrelevant      The survivors unanimously stated that if the victims could have gotten   out they would have  that they were trapped by the tank-destroyed    building and the speed of the fire   For six hours they were trapped   The building was not  destroyed   immediately   They COULD HAVE LEFT AT ANY TIME      The underground bunker cited by the FBI as the place Koresh could have   put the children had he not been a cold blooded killer had been blocked   by the tanks crashing down debris on top of the access door   Six hours to move it away   Or COME OUT      Dick said that he had sat in Koresh s bedroom talking to him and    had observed that his room was furnished like all the rest and without   air condition or other luxuries  directly contradicting the FBI s claim    that he lived in splendor   Irrelevant  anyway   PR one way or the other  but no crime or innocence indicated      Dick saw bullet holes in Koresh s room made from the outside-in   which indicates the BATF was indiscriminately shooting down through   the roof     No word on whether they were being fired back at  which is an operative question here       The fire was probably started by the tanks knocking over Coleman Lanterns    that were lit and sitting on a piano next to the wall the tanks busted    through  though none of the survivors saw the fire start   Right   For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at  any point  and you leave a COLEMAN LANTERN BURNING   Near BALES OF HAY      Every one of the survivors strongly denies ever saying anything to the    FBI about starting the fire  hearing someone say the fire was lit   or any of the other stuff attributed to them by the FBI   It s ultimately irrelevant who  lit  the fire   They had ample opportunity to LEAVE      He said when he first met Koresh in the compound he expected to find    a raving lunatic but instead found a rational  charming and intelligent    young man and was very surprised by that fact     Most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent  actually   They tend to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators    Ex   Ted Bundy       Koresh had no drugs stronger than aspirin to use against pain   Medical assistance was jsut a phone call away   Gee  all he had to do was COME OUT      Women with children had their own bedrooms for them and their kids   that were appointed as nicely as Koresh s   Not relevant to any crimes      Dick said he saw signs of home schooling for the kids and at no time    did he ever see any signs of abuse   While he was there   Anyway  outsiders RARELY see abuse   It s a secretive thing   All we have to go on are the court documents in the Jewell case and the mistrial in California      No one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any   time   The people who were murdered in the fire were there by their   own choices   EXACTLY   By their OWN CHOICE      He called for an independent prosecutor   If ever there were a need   for one  this is it   Looks like there will be several investigations  starting with Congressional committee hearings next week       His closing comments were  They don t look upon themselves as a cult   They view themselves as highly religious people   They sincerely believe  what they believe   And who am you or I to judge that as wrong      His last sentence says it all   Who the hell ARE we  or the government   to judge their religion as wrong   This event  I hope  will be recorded  in history as the American Holocaust   These people were murdered   by the US government just as surely as the jews were by the Nazis   I hang my head in shame for what I ve allowed my government to become   I have NEVER judged them by their religion  but by their ACTIONS   If they had lived a quiet  religious life as they claimed  there would have been no raid  no siege  and no deaths   Instead  they chose courses of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID  if not IRRATIONAL   The first was to stockpile weapons   The second was to shoot federal agents   The third was to stay inside   Just as we don t blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy weapon at him  I don t think the FBI deserves blame in this case   --     The Koresh cult standoff is over     may his victims Recquiescat in Pace                                                                                                        the above is a net moment of silence

T  Jefferson   I think what Jefferson said is still true    And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes  off into the wrong fleshy target   Not very often compared to other use  3    Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife   This isn t that common either  at least when compared to other uses   It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly  get-pissed  and kill someone  gun or not   In most cases  the people who murder have long histories of violence   If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn t kill if they didn t have a gun  feel free to present it    Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to  kill things   Right   Right  but there are times when killing things is called for   I hope I never have to shoot a person  but I ve had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows  and when I do  I don t want them to suffer any more than is necessary   I prefer they die instantly  but failing that  I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot  and failing that  I don t want them to go fast or far   I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I m after  but it doesn t always work as I plan   Without belaboring the point  people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns  particularly handguns  haven t used them much for that purpose     1  Accidental deaths in 1988   48700 deaths by auto  11300 deaths by fall   5300 deaths by drowning   4800 deaths by fire   4400 deaths by poison   3200 deaths by food   1400 deaths by firearm       Source  Statistics Department  National Safety Council        Accidents Facts 1988 Edition   National Safety Council      444 N  Michigan Avenue  Chicago IL  606111   800  621-7619    2  RKBA 002 -

have we learned   For reasons still being kept secret  a federal agency already known  -- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative  committees over the years -- for a longstanding  violent disregard of the law  invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and  personal habits they abominate  violating his rights under the  First  Second  Fourth  Fifth  Ninth  and Fourteenth Amendments to  the Constitution    The man and his followers fight back  killing four of the outlaw  agency s minions  wounding many more  and suffering their own  losses in the process  The agency responds by cutting off his  electricity  water  and especially his contact with the outside  world  They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in  pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency  finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit  eager to gain credit for  straightening out the mess  -- and  more  importantly  to script his side of the subsequent  negotiations   any way they please    The impasse lasts almost two months  ironically  at the same time  four L A  cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a  single individual  sparking one of the ugliest riots in history   Armored vehicles surround the house  already ringed with snipers  using scoped  high-powered rifles  Loudspeakers playing obnoxious  records at the highest possible volume  and searchlights  deprive  those in the house of sleep  in the aftermath  nobody in authority  will mention the effect this technique  originated by North Korean  Communists as a battle tactic  may have had on their judgment     Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising  of the Warsaw Ghetto  some of the armor punches holes in the house  and gas of some kind is injected  The house bursts into flame and  is reduced to ashes in less than an hour  At least 80 lives   including those of more than a dozen children  are snuffed out    Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies  the Attorney General  and the  President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme   blame the victim    He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a  secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being   examined  by the agency that created them  He was abusing children  -- the tapes will

Best of all  he s dead -- he can t say a damn thing to  embarrass us  any more than when his contact with the world was  severed at the start of the whole travesty    A leading national paper claims 93  of the American people believe  that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow  responsible for everything that resulted  But when did you ever  know 93  of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn t this sound  more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll    Very well  what can we infer from the above  For starters  never  forget that  although Democratic careers are on the line  and  rightfully so  over this fiasco  by the outlaw agency s admission   it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration  Which  may explain why Paul Harvey  who evidently used up all his courage  and integrity changing his mind  at about the same time I did   about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a  mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights    More importantly  when Rush Limbaugh  who s been a quivering tower  of Jello during the whole thing  takes essentially the same stance  as Bill Clinton  it s time for fundamental changes  if not in the  system  then at least within yourself    On March 5  back at the beginning  Mary Gingell  national chair of  the Libertarian Party  issued a press release condemning the outlaw  agency and calling for its abolition  In fact  the LP has promised  in its platform since 1977  for at least 16 years  to abolish both  agencies involved in Waco  I m proud to say I was there and helped  to write that plank    True  the LP is tiny and insignificant  although less so than in  1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it   But  alone  in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their  behinds with phony polls and Big Lies  the LP is right about what  happened in Waco  And if their advice had been followed in 1977   Waco never would have happened    Think about it  And think about the fact that  if you ve had enough  of political parties more interested in collecting and holding  power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights  let alone human  life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty  maybe  the change it s time for within yourself is to make the LP less  tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote   Think about it   L  Neil Smith Author  THE PROBABILITY BROACH  THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE  HENRY MARTYN   and  forthcoming  PALLAS Editor  LEVER ACTION BBS  303  493-6674  FIDOnet  1 306

		<snippet>From  cathy LANCE ColoState Edu  Cathy Smith  Subject  NO SURRENDER -- Lenda Jackson  NO SURRENDER  Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver  April 18  1993  It is a fact of modern life that urban residents  particularly women  feel threatened  A certain number of them actually are threatened  There are immediate threats  the things that women will tell you they re afraid of  The noise downstairs at night  The lonely walk to the car  The stranger at the door  The abusive husband  finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children  The burglar    The mugger   the rapist    And what are we told is the solution  Move  Get a dog  Keep the door locked  Call the police  as a next-to-last resort  learn martial arts  and always  there s the implied question  what s a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you   But what if you don t like dogs  Like living alone  Don t have 10 years to devote learning judo   What if  after examining the facts  a woman learns that  rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed - and were less likely to be injured Kleck 124  than those using any other form of resistance  Kleck 126   also true for robbery assault  Kleck 123    What if  to our horror and despair  we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a crime has been committed  In truth  the Supreme Court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual  only the whole community   As a society  are we going to ask women  once again  to sacrifice themselves  Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves   Here s a thought  Neil Smith  in his book The Probability Broach  says  no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110- pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out   But if a woman decides to protect herself  with the easiest  most efficient means possible  people - especially other women - are horrified   Eughh  how could you  I d be terrified   they ask  How could you hurt someone  They ll repeat the lie  it ll just get taken away from you  In truth  1  of  defensive gun uses  result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim  122 Kleck   Well  despite the lies  and the social pressure  some of us have already made that hard choice  We ve decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers  burglars or rapists  We re buying more guns than every before  We re learning how to use them - and teaching others  women and men  how to use them  Most importantly  we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense  We re taking our own security  literally  into our own hands  We re going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT   But there s another threat  more insatiable than any mugger  more secretive than any burglar  more soul-destroying than any rapist   That menace is government  and it threatens us all  We know that governments  throughout time  have suppressed rights and oppressed people  It s the way they survive   In our names and with our money  it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad  It lies to us  cheats us  steals from us and threatens us with violence  No one knows exactly what it ll do next - what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides  it s for your own safety  or  we know best   Any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender   But this monster called government persists  and grows  And we  who should be its masters  have become its unwilling slaves  Do you doubt me  Then why did you file your income tax    Like any reasonable person  I believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart  and that paranoia isn t crazy if someone s really after you  And make no mistake  they re after you and they re after me  Their names are familiar  Brady and Reynolds  Groff  Metzenbahm  Moynihan  and Clinton  If we re lucky  they ll settle for our assault rifles  our shotguns  our handguns and our ammunition    As citizens  we have only two choices  They are the same two choices given to women  to surrender or to fight    Surrender leads to the gulag  to the genocide of Pol Pot  to the disappearances  to Dachau  I do not intend to surrender    A battle can be philosophical or political  in the main  the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office  But if they have to  they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson   the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots    As a patriot  I will point out the error in the government s ways  I will do my best to vote the villains out of office  I will protest  and write  and speak  and teach our children justice  honor and truth  And always remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga      or it can lead to Tiananmen Square    When the time comes to stand up  if I have to give my life to keep them from going too far  if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future  I intend to be there  And no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass  I intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick    My opinions are  of course  my own   </snippet>

		<snippet>From  oaf zurich ai mit edu  Oded Feingold  Subject  Dealing with cults - a few thoughts  In the wake of the Waco denouement  I had email discussions with people from this group   In particular  we discussed how cults operate  why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did  and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations   I include an edited account of what I wrote   The identity of my correspondents have  I hope  been erased   The editing process makes the text choppy - sorry about that   I ve tried to retain the information content   Ellipses       indicate where text was removed   A few of the comments in parentheses are new  intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand   These notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize   Cheers     Oded  ------------------------  begin included text  -----------------------  I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS       The course included cults and briefly mentioned analyzed Jonestown    Did some external reading too    William Adorno     edited a series of books on the psychology of  evil  mass movements     starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY  University of Chicago Press  1948     an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII  and by extension in other wars  in racial lynchings      I don t think the books are perfect  and the study of psychopathology has advanced      but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume   So I think they re onto something   ----------------------------------------------------------------------   How cult psychology works      I m an amateur   Hope I m not hopelessly naive    So long as Koresh could  own  his people  he made sure they didn t believe there was any life out there for them  away from him  Otherwise  he d  Koresh  be nothing   During the siege  ex-Davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls  Absolutely classic brainwashing technique       As long as they believed him  they d ignore BATF FBI Child Protective Services or even the Red Cross asking them to come out   After all  if they ever left him  God would catapult them straight to Hell  and the combined forces of the US gummint  with all the goodwill in the world  doubtful  couldn t save them for a second   If I believed it  I d stay and die too  like the folks in Jonestown   For a prosaic analogy  replace a cult leader with an estranged wife  or husband   and notice how many folks show up  kill the ex and then themselves   That s the consequence of shattered  cultism    It really does happen all the time    By the way  the treasured ideal in such cases  without which life is meaningless  is the relationship  no matter how abusive  rather than the individual s partner         ----------------------------------------------------------------------      Why No News  Don t The Feds Owe The World An Explanation    I agree that official explanations are in order   I can also see good      reasons for news blackouts     The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted     yesterday  those people would be alive today        that no matter what  those people would have died  because Koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence  Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted   He held them hostage  as his trump against going to jail  but nothing would really stop him from offing them   Even if the FBI went away   Look at history   Rep Leo Ryan  and some staffers  visited Jonestown  at the request of constituents who had relatives there   Once Jonestown was discovered  and even though they killed Ryan and his entourage     they all killed themselves  because Jim Jones knew he d be busted   Internal arguments asking to spare the children  brought up by some of the women in the cult  were shouted down   There are tapes     The  logic  of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is  it wouldn t kill the kids  was shouted down as blasphemy  and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour   I suspect it s the same with the Branch Davidians   There s a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr   titled OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HELL   I don t know whether it s good - never read it        The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment  or organizations buying full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS  on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves       So  the only way the BATF FBI could  save  those people  and future cults  is by ignoring such signs   I suppose there s another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him into letting them go  or somehow influencing  his  people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world      a mighty tough row to hoe       I suspect the FBI tried to do that with blackouts  noise and other sensory insults   However  maybe they re not very sophisticated  or maybe the job is impossible   It s certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk       ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after           - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD s from Koresh  they d want to keep it quiet so they wouldn t be embarrassed           - if they were trying to wean the BD s from Koresh  they d want to keep it quiet so he couldn t outflank them  or well-meaning boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn t screw it up       I  hate  playing chess when the world screams in my face  especially if at checkmate time people really die  and I could be blamed        I don t think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy  unless you deny the FBI  BATF  Child Protective Services  of whatever stripe  and the rest of the gummint should exist at all       the end  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Okay  have at it   </snippet>

		<snippet>From  viking iastate edu  Dan Sorenson  Subject  Re  Rewording the Second Amendment  ideas   dfo vttoulu tko vtt fi  Foxvog Douglas  writes     viking iastate edu  Dan Sorenson  writes      That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining   these weapons     This means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough   Good    Very narrow   Very  very narrow   If you ll recall  I was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain situations   How can you possibly define what is a weapon and what isn t is only the start of this     and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of   modern practice five months or five centuries down the road      I would hope so   Let s define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon  whose majority of energy comes from fission and or fusion of atomic  nuclei    And you ve just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered   Reactors blow with a steam explosion  but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant   See what a can of worms this is   Last I heard  Ft  Calhoun station just north of Omaha  Nebraska wasn t considered a weapon   Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now  I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years   With the PRISM design  there is  no  operator input needed on the reactor itself  and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future   So your definition is flawed in a few respects already      Let s define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses   in such state  quantity  and with such a vector that they could cause   death or serious disease  further defined  to a significant number of  people if released in a city  similarly populated area  resevoir  or  cropland      Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed   If you don t mind extrapolation  any HIV-positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus   Finally  that manure pile I mention below fits this definition  as does  say  releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild    Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined   Other poisonous  gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there  is no use not related to weaponry   Licenses should be available for  research purposes on such chemicals    And I can show where any such gas has other uses   For example  perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers   Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas   It can be used for welding  in miners lamps  for gassing gophers  or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing   Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you ll see that it can also be a weapon  just like any other flammable substance  So  now my miners lamps won t work  I can t do any welding  and I still have those pesky gophers    I am not a lawyer  but these ideas could certainly be a basis for   definitions    The basis for  but I m sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law  it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good     I ll give   you a little hint   see that manure pile in the farmer s field down the   road   In the USA  that is a weapon of mass destruction     Nope   It is not considered a weapon    It is under your proposed law   So is a silage pit if there is run-off   So are underground fuel tanks     biological in   nature  because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate   the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water   So    where do  you  draw the line   In the USA  the EPA has ruled that   a pile of scrap iron is illegal   Care to draw a thinner line this time    It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction   Many things are  banned for other reasons    It meets all the criterion of a weapon   It is an instrument that can be used for fighting  even though that is not its intended purpose  and despite there being better weapons around   Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water  mass destruction is rather a given    It s not that certain weapons aren t something I d rather not see a lot of people having   The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some pretext or another   The looser your definition  the more ripe for abuse that law is   Furthermore  if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to  generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law   Again  ripe for abuse     Dan Sorenson  DoD  1066 z1dan exnet iastate edu viking iastate edu      ISU only

		<snippet>From  lvc cbnews cb att com  Larry Cipriani  Subject  Don Kates  talk on the Branch Davidians  This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list   I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation    Of course  this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion    So  yesterday I went to hear him   What follows is a rough summary of what I think I heard him say  which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said     Kates started by saying that since he didn t know any more about the fire than the audience did  it had just happened the day before   he would not discuss that  but would concentrate on the original raid   Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck   But so what   This isn t the first time that the leader of a new  small religious group has been ridiculed by the public   Extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust   The first amendment applies  maybe especially  to people like Koresh   Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US  There were none until about 1830  when they began in metropolitan areas  Police originally were not armed  if they found a crime in progress  they called local armed citizens to help   Many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them  eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns   The original intent was to have many small police departments  jealous of one another and competitive  but not large enough to be a threat to liberty  hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard   When the FBI was started  agents did not have the authority oto carry guns  they were to be  after all  a bureau of investigation  not a police force    All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power    The BATF started as a tax collection agency  whose primary job was to raid illegal stills   When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable  many illegal stills disappeared  and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its existence  so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores  Around the time when the BATF s annual budget is under review  the media is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place  where at a pre-arranged time  a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly   The media isn t invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork  but if any irregularities are found  the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises  and the luckless FFL in chains   The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF s budget was up for review   Kates  opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad  and that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at  or they would have planned the raid differently  not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover  for example   and would have had some medical personnel on hand   He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh s arrest in connection with a murder charge  and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it   Koresh sais  ok  come pick me up  and the sheriff did  temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested   Koresh was later cleared  release  and presumably got his guns back   At least at that time  he was rational enough to be approached rationally  and behaved in a reasonable manner   The BATF didn t take into account that  unlike most of the FFL s they audit  Koresh was actually paranoid  and fostered paranoia in his followers   Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them  and they reacted accordingly   With respect to the original warrant  it had not been unsealed when Kates was giving his talk  so he could not comment on it  except to mention that the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their informants  if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant   He had more to say about the way the warrant was served  which may have been completely illegal   Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you re an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so  if they don t open the door and the evidence is flushable  then it is ok to break in the door   But since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet  there may have been no justification for the BATF breaking in the way they did   If the constitutional rights of the Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant  or by an improperly served warrant  then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons   A close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent  may  have shot himself by accident when entering the building  if so  this was the first shot fired   The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse   After an initial position on the side of the BATF  the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad  possibly illegal attack   A real cynic might say that the FBI went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides  and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the public s sympathy   Should the BATF be abolished   No   Police agencies  should  be numerous  diverse  inefficient  decentralized  etc   Better a few inept accidents like this  than a move toward a single  large  well-organized  well-trained  powerful  domestic police force  which would eventually have even more tragic results      - Lyn Bates       bates bbn com   PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston College Law School next Tuesday  April 27   I don t know the exact time or place  but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that information  --  Larry

exactly are you trying to say   And why were there no fire-engines within     a mile of the compound       Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that   has a range of 3000 meters   They were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo   50mm would be 5cm  a shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells   Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire   Besides  the ranch house  not  fort apocalypse   it was just a house despite what the FBI and ATF says  was on  fire    The  Gun loonies  couldn t hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames  The FBI and ATF don t have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the blaze   The bastards waited until the fire was  well  under way before they called the fire department in Waco   They didn t even tell the fire department to be on standby   I sincerely hope that the FBI  ATF  Attorney General Janet Reno  and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve  Someone should pay for this needless  tragic waste of human life   Sadly  these evil SOBs will probably never face justice   The media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely David Koresh s fault   Sadder still  the American people will probably believe them     Next question          The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters   to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place   This is not the problem   the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every day   If people decide to own guns  and  live in one place together then that is their prerogative   On the other hand  if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their compound  But  the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons hasn t been proven yet  so I m not going to conclude that the BDs broke any laws   David Koresh was accused of abusing children  but if this is his  only  crime then the presence of the ATF can t be justified  The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms  tobacco  and alcohol violations   ATF agents are basically cigarette cops   they should stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of their jurisdiction   Better yet  they should be s  tcanned IMO     The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to   attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention  If the FBI had   had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type   raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults   Sounds like something the SS would do   Human life---children and adults alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are  heavily-armed religious wackos    David Koresh s lawyer seemed to think that everyone  would  come out peacefully sooner or later   The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON THEIR HANDS   Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy   Their job is to protect the public and SAVE LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud     It really was a no win situation  Koresh had plenty of opportunity    to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers  Instead   he ordered the murder of the children    Don t be so sure about that   I read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire   This cult member also said that David Koresh had  no  intentions of committing mass suicide   David Koresh s lawyer also confirms this  Therefore  if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE   Even if this is not true  the FBI and ATF still don t get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the Waco fire department   Perhaps they wanted all these people to die     In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive   the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the    suicide murder of his other 80 followers  According to the account given   the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met   by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them  The Koresh gun supporter   claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up  If the    AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier   grade weaponry than standard issue handguns  For all practical purposes   they were unarmed  the B-D followers had automatic weapons    You re wrong on several accounts   ATF agents were adequately armed   They had MP5s  AR-15s  and shotguns   Some agents were armed with automatic pistols but not all were   The ATF s initial claim---which they later retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous     The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely  The B-D were   quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any   time  A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have   achieved that objective  that would have been very risky  orders of    magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige  Airplanes   and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch    apocalypse was  6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties   than 80       Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either  besides the serious   risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the    question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over   a prolonged period  The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared   Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege  Rather than go   in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon          Can you think of a better way of getting the children out       A 100  certain way          The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire   government story  This is simply rationalisation  It is not enough for    them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent  That would require   them to come up with a solution themselves  Instead they have to come   up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to   set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them   to get gun control legislation through   Gun control isn t the only issue here   If the sick little monkeys in Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f   ed up they are   What concerns me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government seems to be able to get away with s  t like they did in Waco   they are becoming more and more callous about people s rights and the law   This greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well     This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its   agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the   middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters       Still the conspiracy theory is comforting  it allows them to pretend that   WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in    resolving a hostage crisis  No govt in the world has ever faced a    comparable situation  quite probably there was no manner in which it   could be peacefully resolved  The blame does not rest on the FBI  it   rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far  in particular   the person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF   agents and 17 children on his or her conscience          There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society   preach salvation through armed security  The fact is that these are the   very people who pose the threat to society in the first place  The next WACO   may not be religious nutters but a political movement  A splinter group   of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example   and holding several hundred children hostage       The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent   them arising  No other government in the world has faced such a situation     this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power   weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah   to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire          Phill Hallam-Baker   Scott Kennedy   Brewer and Patriot  Before    David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets           the Bible through the barrel of a gun

I  suspect you ll find if you look carefully that 135 000 is the number of  students  estimated  to have carried  a weapon   not necessarily a gun   to school at least once in the past year  and not the number of students  who carry a gun to school daily     Well Joe  I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence or the Centers for Disease Control   If YOU look carefully you will see that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths  The CPHV reports that 135 000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that 400 000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year   The CDC estimates that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once in 1990   The CDC also says that 1 2 million elementary-aged  latch-key children  kids who come home from school to an empty house   have access to guns in their home   California schools reported a 200  increase in student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990  and a 40  increase between 1988 and 1990   Florida reported a 61  percent increase in gun incidents in schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88   These are the  statistics           thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah  Got news   for you folks  if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours   presently  he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they   were in danger       Holding kids    Time for a reality check  son   These kids were the  children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were  outside waiting to kill them   Would you send  your  children out the door  if you believed as they did     Okay  maybe I worded it wrong   DAD   I meant that to put children in a situation  fortified compound  where harm could come to them is not the act of a Messiah in my opinion   I m not saying that Koresh had control over these children directly  but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is would not let innocent children die  If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such  why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive   Thanks for the reality check Joe  its been real    Rodney </snippet>

I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point   Have you ever been shot at   How clear and logically could you think  under that pressure  when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluate what is going on   And  it would not be the first time that  law enforcements  intended to bring in their suspect horizontally   For all we know  he was informed by someone saying something like  Hey  guy  the BATF is coming like gangbusters  and they mean to WASTE you      According to the latest news  the released warrant  so we are told  said the reason for this WW III raid was that Korash s group had spent around  200 000 00 on firearms and related stuff  over an undetermined period   Now  even assuming that the figure isn t calculated like the Feds do a drug siezure  for 90 people  that isn t really all that much  you priced decent guns lately     Hell  I can think of a person right now that probably has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL  mostly machineguns     Sure  he is an avid collector  but unless a new law has been passed  it is NOT illegal  nor an indication of anything illegal  to have a lot of guns   Also note that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS   So  what is the justification of this cowboy raid  other than a romp gone bad for some anti-gun media hype  to support Clinton s push for disarming the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons  This administration has only one thing in mind   CONTROL   PEOPLE CONTROL  Whether it is gun control  Clinton Cripple Chip  National smart ID cards  it all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL   Can you say 1984  only 10 years late  I knew you could      -    laws  they would have been released as they had been before   If this  had happened and it turned out that the BATF had used too much force   then the BDs would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges  of civil rights violations  Sounds a lot like LA  huh   Don t take that  wrong  I m not commenting one way or the other about the Rodney King  case    But that s not what they wanted   They got tipped off that the  BATF was on the way in  and rather than adopting a non-violent   non-threatening posture to greet the BATF  they decided to fight   And BATF knew the BDs were expecting them  via 60 minutes report    But they decided they were so big  so bad  they would have a cakewalk at the BDs expense  for a nice media show anyway   But it all turned to shit  and the FBI taking over to manage things  we see it all turned to shit  too   Clinton says  I am taking full responsibility      BAH  Responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong   Bet you NOBODY pays any serious repercussions    Responsibility  only has meaning as media PR  or as a means to corner the average Joe Schmoe  Figure it out    Clinton  Reno  the FBI and BATF  will all be IMMUNE  Can you say WHITEWASH    I ve said enough of this issue   I m probably not going to convince any  of you folks and you re certainly not going to convince me   I ve got  work to do           Don  Be VERY afraid of our government   In the land of the free    And if you decide all this is acceptable  get even MORE afraid    especially when it is YOU they decide  for some reason  they dislike    When they no longer feel the need to confine their cowboy tactics to  kooks   or  wierdos      --  pat rwing uucp       Without prejudice UCC 1-207       Pat Myrto  Seattle  WA          If all else fails  try            uunet pilchuck rwing pat WISDOM   Only two things are infinite  the universe and human stupidity           and I am not sure about the former                -

I    suspect you ll find if you look carefully that 135 000 is the number of    students  estimated  to have carried  a weapon   not necessarily a gun     to school at least once in the past year  and not the number of students    who carry a gun to school daily         Well Joe  I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence   or the Centers for Disease Control   If YOU look carefully you will see   that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths    The CPHV reports that 135 000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that   400 000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year   The CDC estimates   that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once   in 1990   The CDC also says that 1 2 million elementary-aged  latch-key   children  kids who come home from school to an empty house   have access   to guns in their home   California schools reported a 200  increase in   student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990  and a 40  increase between   1988 and 1990   Florida reported a 61  percent increase in gun incidents in   schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88   These are the  statistics        200  increase in California schools  eh   Gun control is working fine  there              thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah  Got news     for you folks  if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours     presently  he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they     were in danger           Holding kids    Time for a reality check  son   These kids were the    children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were    outside waiting to kill them   Would you send  your  children out the door    if you believed as they did         Okay  maybe I worded it wrong   DAD   I meant that to put children in a   situation  fortified compound  where harm could come to them is not the   act of a Messiah in my opinion   I m not saying that Koresh had control over   these children directly  but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is   would not let innocent children die    If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such  why   did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them   burn alive   Thanks for the reality check Joe  its been real     So your religion is different   Does that make it his wrong   Even assuming   Koresh actually made that decision  and the verdict is still out on that       Rodney  Jim -- jmd handheld com -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I m always rethinking that   There s never been a day when I haven t rethought   that   But I can t do that by myself    Bill Clinton  6 April 93  If I were an American  as I am an Englishman  while a foreign troop was landed   in my country  I never would lay down my arms -never--never--never   WILLIAM PITT  EARL OF CHATHAM 1708-1778 18 Nov  1777 </snippet>

		<snippet>From  Thomas Parsli  thomasp ifi uio no  Subject  guns Amex AND new name         I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America   What I ve said is that there seems to be to MANY of them  and especially to many in wrong hands      Now IF you would like to reduce the number  how would you do it without affecting good responcible gun owners      I DO believe in a persons freedom  What I don t believe is that you can have it all and don t pay for it   MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals  and that you HAVE to give  a little  to make that society work   Cars and guns should really not be mixed  I just tried to make a point  Like America  Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b  so a car is essential in most parts      Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway  so we don t  argue that IF we  banned  guns we HAVE to ban cars        EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were more guns in Germany in the 30 s  PLEASE read some HISTORY    Is this discussion about  1  Banning weapons for ALL Americans             or 2  Making it harder for criminals to get one       Change of name        Wrote that one after reading the first postings about the Waco  incident   I still think there are  some  posters should move their post to alt conspiracy or make a new newsgroup   If you read the first postings after the Waco fire you should see who I mean         Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons   Child abuse for instance   Doesn t the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari news   hierarcy     Some seems rather mis unInformed    Or is the clari news   hierarcy ruled and censored by the corrupt facist goverment                                           Thomas Parsli  </snippet>

		<snippet>From  viking iastate edu  Dan Sorenson  Subject  Re  guns Amex AND new name       Thomas Parsli  thomasp ifi uio no  writes    Remember me  Tom   I hope you ll respond  and I seem to be a Voice of Reason or some such  I ve been recieving fan mail  so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late   and hope to make a few points here    I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America    What I ve said is that there seems to be to MANY of them  and especially  to many in wrong hands       And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don t   A fairly simple problem  given our size and numbers   Do you agree   We all believe criminals  particularly violent criminals  should not have firearms   The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority   Nobody here seems to be able to do it  and I doubt anybody in Norway can either   Thus  we are left with a philosophical difference  does the safety of a few justify restricting the many   We say  no   while others say  yes     Now IF you would like to reduce the number  how would you do it without  affecting good responcible gun owners      Can you provide a method that cannot be abused   I doubt it    I DO believe in a persons freedom   What I don t believe is that you can have it all and don t pay for it    Of course   This is not in contention   What is in contention is how much one has to pay    MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals  and that you HAVE  to give  a little  to make that society work    It is this  giving a little  that makes Americans wary    We have seen this argument before   You might remember how a Chamberlain  gave a little  to a particular fascist short asshole  and how such  appeasement  worked   While it might work in some instances  it doesn t work in others  and since we cannot predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of failure    Cars and guns should really not be mixed  I just tried to make a point   Like America  Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b   so a car is essential in most parts      Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway  so we don t   argue that IF we  banned  guns we HAVE to ban cars        Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in the USA   I m willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price   Thus  cars are not essential for your transportation   However  the arguments presented show that  since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the USA  it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does guns   How one defines  essential  often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that service   When we look at the raw data  such comparisons are not individually weighed    EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were  more guns in Germany in the 30 s  PLEASE read some HISTORY    This depends upon what the populace was willing to do   As Desert Storm proved  even an armed populace won t just revolt even when given a chance   Still  would Hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace   We have to wonder  as some of his first acts were to confiscate firearms   Other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace  Thus  we re left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony  One can argue both sides  one also has to live with each action    Is this discussion about  1  Banning weapons for ALL Americans              or  2  Making it harder for criminals to get one      It is about  2  but so far all proposals to curtail  2 have wound up enforcing  1 as well   I only wish that  or  was so logical    Change of name          That was  on my part  purely in jest   I merely pointed out how we were from similar backgrounds racially  but of wholly different backgrounds politically   I thought this would underscore my point on how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage    Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons    Child abuse for instance    BATF can  only  enforce gun tobaccco alcohol violations   Child abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities    Doesn t the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari news     hierarcy      Some seems rather mis unInformed    That hierarchy is a paid-for feed at many sites   Most people do not get it for this reason  and I suspect money  not censorship  is the main reason   Do you get alt sex  at your site   I can t read it here because of censorship and legal fears  so again our differences show  You have topless sunbathing  and in the USA we can watch a murder every fifteen seconds and yet breasts are forbidden on television     Dan Sorenson  DoD  1066 z1dan exnet iastate edu viking iastate edu      ISU only censors what I read  not what I say   Don t blame them           USENET  Post to exotic  distant

children  Cars  falls       burns  drowning  food ingestion are all much larger cause of      deaths  7 988       So  firearms are the 6th leading cause  after drowning and choking on  food  at least for 1988     Sorry Charles   According to the National Safety Council  ACCIDENT FACTS 1991  In 1990  gun accidents were the fifth-leading cause of accidental death for children ages 14 and under        I don t understand how the ratio to other accidental    deaths is important   So guns don t kill as many children as car accidents     What is the difference in severity between 1 000 deaths and 10 000 deaths     The difference is that a rational person would address the leading  cause  first   and address the lesser causes later     That thinking is so screwed up  I don t even know how to respond to it  A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths  and not attempt to affect childhood falls  drownings  gunshot injuries  etc                  So this so called rational person   using your definition   if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer  and would not try to decrease LESSER

Charles  I ll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of death   And you call your local police homicide department  liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes  Please  quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles    I ve got an idea Charles  why don t you start a talk politics caraccidents group or talk politics fall group   This is talk politics guns   Don t confuse the issue   Just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another  we should not try to address it   I don t agree  I m not posting to t p g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths  I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it         I assumed that any humane    person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents    gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends     A  humane person  who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old  would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm   Ignorance is our greatest enemy     Again Charles  you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes   The statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who  like you  expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority   I guess  maybe Humane person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh  Both would be defined as  a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths    If that is the case  I m extremely glad that I am inhumane and irrational        Well Joe  I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence                                                                                  What  other  sources of information do you have which confirms their  data   These folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts   Perhaps you can verify their data with the Uniform Crime Report      Sorry Charles  the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting the facts   But if you insist  according to the 1990 UCR   Firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990    Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you   They state that  Every day  12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents  suicides  and homicides   Many more are wounded     Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry   They say  Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990     Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles     They state that  Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300  from 1986 to 1988     Charles  I hope you don t need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns   If you don t realize this fact   I don t care if you go by CDC or FBI data  or if you go into the homes  schools  and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself   I m not going to bother to try to convince you   Its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion   I really don t want to do that       or the Centers for Disease Control                                         They have firearm statistics   Are firearms a disease     Charles  it s obvious that you know nothing about the CDC  They don t just study cancer and heart disease   I ve got news for you  interpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic   In 1984  Surgeon General C  Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health problem as cancer  heart disease  or auto accidents       that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths     In  the lives of youths  or in their schools   I know a number of  youths who have firearms present  in their lives    Is is quite  appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms  this is a   presence   right     What are you trying to say   This innuendo  reminds me of listening to Bill Clinton    WHO THE F  K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE FIREARM CHARLES    In the future  if you are going to post to t p g and jump into a previous discussion  please read the entire posting  not just 1 sentence that you decide to respond to  What the hell are you saying here    You re wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that isn t       The CPHV reports that 135 000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that    400 000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year     I wouldn t trust their statistics without  independent  verification       The CDC estimates    that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once    in 1990     Based on CPHV statistics   Based on UCR      Based on what       The CDC also says that 1 2 million elementary-aged  latch-key    children  kids who come home from school to an empty house   have access    to guns in their home     Therefore      What is the purpose of this claim    Charles buddy  I m getting really tired of this   Do you live on the planet Mars     As a physicist  I realize that you probably don t come into contact with many youth  but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools   In addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids   Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods  whether they know anyone who has been shot  whether they know anyone who has a gun  whether they have ever held a gun  and whether they themselves have ever been shot    Believe me Charles  THAT will be your  INDEPENDENT  VERIFICATION                                                                                Rodney W  Thomas                    R1328 vmcms csuohio edu Urban

Carrot2 Command Line Interface Applications
-------------------------------------------

Carrot2 Command Line Interface Applications enable you to run clustering in batch mode.
To perform clustering of the example data included in the distribution archive type:

batch.cmd input  (on Windows)
./batch.sh input (on Linux)

and look for the "output" directory for the results. Run the script without parameters 
to see the available switches. The CLI applications require a Java Runtime Environment 
(JRE) version 1.7.0 or later.
